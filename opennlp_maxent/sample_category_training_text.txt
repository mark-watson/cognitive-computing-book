chemistry mixed bodies in chymistry meant a scientific art by which one learns to dissolve bodies and draw from them the different
chemistry different substances on their composition and how to unite them again and exalt them to a higher perfection this definition was

chemistry jean baptiste dumas considered the word chemistry to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces
chemistry forces this definition further evolved until in it came to mean the science of substances their structure their properties and the
chemistry the reactions that change them into other substances a characterization accepted by linus pauling more recently in the definition of chemistry
chemistry chemistry was broadened to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes as phrased by professor raymond chang the

chemistry atoms molecules substances metals crystals and other aggregates of matter this matter can be studied in solid liquid or gas states
chemistry states in isolation or in combination the interactions reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of
chemistry of interactions between atoms leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together such behaviors are studied in a
chemistry a chemistry laboratory the chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware however glassware is not central to chemistry and
chemistry and a great deal of experimental as well as applied industrial chemistry is done without it a chemical reaction is a
chemistry a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances the basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement
chemistry rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms it can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation which usually involves
chemistry involves atoms as subjects the number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation
chemistry transformation is equal when unequal the transformation by definition is not chemical but rather a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay the
chemistry the type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain
chemistry certain basic rules known as chemical laws energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies chemical substances
chemistry substances are classified in terms of their structure phase as well as their chemical compositions they can be analyzed using the
chemistry the tools of chemical analysis e g spectroscopy and chromatography scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists most chemists
chemistry chemists specialize in one or more sub disciplines several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry some of them are
chemistry are the atom is the basic unit of chemistry it consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by
chemistry by a space called the electron cloud the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and neutrons that have no
chemistry no charge while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus in a neutral atom the negatively
chemistry negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons the atom is also the smallest entity that can be

chemistry number and preferred types of bonds to form e g metallic ionic covalent element standard form of the periodic table of
chemistry of chemical elements the colors represent different categories of elements main article chemical element the concept of chemical element is related
chemistry related to that of chemical substance a chemical element is specifically a pure substance which is composed of a single type
chemistry type of atom a chemical element is characterized by a particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms this
chemistry this number is known as the atomic number of the element for example all atoms with protons in their nuclei are
chemistry are atoms of the chemical element carbon and all atoms with protons in their nuclei are atoms of the element uranium
chemistry uranium although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same number of protons they may
chemistry may not necessarily have the same number of neutrons such atoms are termed isotopes in fact several isotopes of an element
chemistry element may exist ninety four different chemical elements or types of atoms based on the number of protons are observed on
chemistry on earth naturally having at least one isotope that is stable or has a very long half life a further elements
chemistry elements have been recognised by iupac after they have been made in the laboratory the standard presentation of the chemical elements
chemistry elements is in the periodic table which orders elements by atomic number and groups them by electron configuration due to its
chemistry its arrangement groups or columns and periods or rows of elements in the table either share several chemical properties or a
chemistry a certain trend in characteristics such as atomic radius electronegativity etc lists of the elements by name by symbol and by
chemistry by atomic number are also available a compound is a pure chemical substance that consists of two or more elements combined
chemistry combined together in a compound there is a particular ratio of atoms of particular chemical elements which determines its composition and
chemistry and a particular organization which determines its chemical properties for example water is a compound containing hydrogen and oxygen in the
chemistry the ratio of two to one with the oxygen atom between the two hydrogen atoms and an angle of between them
chemistry them compounds are formed and interconverted by chemical reactions a chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition
chemistry composition and set of properties strictly speaking a mixture of compounds elements or compounds and elements is not a chemical substance
chemistry substance but it may be called a chemical most of the substances we encounter in our daily life are some kind
chemistry kind of mixture for example air alloys biomass etc nomenclature of substances is a critical part of the language of chemistry
chemistry chemistry generally it refers to a system for naming chemical compounds earlier in the history of chemistry substances were given name
chemistry name by their discoverer which often led to some confusion and difficulty however today the iupac system of chemical nomenclature allows
chemistry allows chemists to specify by name specific compounds amongst the vast variety of possible chemicals the standard nomenclature of chemical substances
chemistry substances is set by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac there are well defined systems in place for
chemistry for naming chemical species organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system inorganic compounds are named according to the
chemistry the inorganic nomenclature system in addition the chemical abstracts service has devised a method to index chemical substances in this scheme
chemistry scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its cas registry number a molecule is the smallest indivisible
chemistry indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties that is its potential to undergo
chemistry undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances however this definition only works well for substances that are composed
chemistry composed of molecules which is not true of many substances see below molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together
chemistry together by covalent bonds such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either
chemistry either in bonds or in lone pairs thus molecules exist as electrically neutral units unlike ions when this rule is broken
chemistry broken giving the molecule a charge the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion however the discrete
chemistry discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well separated form such
chemistry such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrograph charged polyatomic collections residing in solids for example common
chemistry common sulfate or nitrate ions are generally not considered molecules in chemistry a d skeletal model of a benzene molecule c
chemistry c h the inert or noble gas elements helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon are composed of lone atoms as
chemistry as their smallest discrete unit but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to
chemistry to each other in some way identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water air and many organic compounds like alcohol
chemistry alcohol sugar gasoline and the various pharmaceuticals however not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules and indeed most
chemistry most of the solid substances that makes up the solid crust mantle and core of the earth are chemical compounds without
chemistry without molecules these other types of substances such as ionic compounds and network solids are organized in such a way as
chemistry as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se instead these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or
chemistry or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance examples of such substances are mineral salts such as table
chemistry table salt solids like carbon and diamond metals and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite one of
chemistry of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure while the structure of diatomic triatomic or
chemistry or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial linear angular pyramidal etc the structure of polyatomic molecules that are constituted of more
chemistry more than six atoms of several elements can be crucial for its chemical nature mole and amount of substance main article
chemistry article mole unit the mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance also called chemical amount specifically
chemistry specifically it is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities atoms molecules or ions as there are
chemistry are atoms in kilogram or grams of carbon where the carbon atoms are unbound at rest and in their ground state
chemistry state the number of entities per mole is known as the avogadro constant and is determined empirically the currently accepted value
chemistry value is mol codata one way to understand the meaning of the term mole is to compare and contrast it to
chemistry to terms such as dozen just as one dozen eggs contains individual eggs one mole contains atoms molecules or other particles
chemistry particles the term is used because it is much easier to say for example mole of carbon than it is to
chemistry to say carbon atoms and because moles of chemicals represent a scale that is easy to experience the amount of substance
chemistry substance of a solute per volume of is known as amount of substance concentration or molarity for short molarity is the
chemistry the quantity most commonly used to express the concentration of a solution in the chemical laboratory the most commonly used units
chemistry units for molarity are mol l the official si units are mol m properties ions and salts the crystal lattice structure
chemistry structure of potassium chloride kcl a salt which is formed due to the attraction of k cations and cl anions note
chemistry note how the overall charge of the ionic compound is zero main article ion an ion is a charged species an
chemistry an atom or a molecule that has lost or gained one or more electrons when an atom loses an electron and
chemistry and thus has more protons than electrons the atom is a positively charged ion or cation when an atom gains an
chemistry an electron and thus has more electrons than protons the atom is a negatively charged ion or anion cations and anions
chemistry anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral salts such as the na and cl ions forming sodium chloride or nacl
chemistry nacl examples of polyatomic ions that do not split up during acid base reactions are hydroxide oh and phosphate po ions
chemistry ions in the gaseous phase are often known as plasma atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be
chemistry be bonded with one another a chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the
chemistry the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them more than simple attraction and repulsion the energies and distributions characterize the
chemistry the availability of an electron to bond to another atom a chemical bond can be a covalent bond an ionic bond
chemistry bond a hydrogen bond or just because of van der waals force each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to
chemistry to some potential these potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals in many simple compounds valence
chemistry valence bond theory the valence shell electron pair repulsion model vsepr and the concept of oxidation number can be used to
chemistry to explain molecular structure and composition an ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons
chemistry electrons becoming a positively charged cation and the electrons are then gained by the non metal atom becoming a negatively charged
chemistry charged anion the two oppositely charged ions attract one another and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between
chemistry between them for example sodium na a metal loses one electron to become an na cation while chlorine cl a non
chemistry non metal gains this electron to become cl the ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction and that compound sodium
chemistry sodium chloride nacl or common table salt is formed in the methane molecule ch the carbon atom shares a pair of
chemistry of valence electrons with each of the four hydrogen atoms thus the octet rule is satisfied for c atom it has
chemistry has eight electrons in its valence shell and the duet rule is satisfied for the h atoms they have two electrons
chemistry electrons in their valence shells when a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or
chemistry or with energy a chemical reaction is said to have occurred a chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the
chemistry the reaction of a substance when it comes in close contact with another whether as a mixture or a solution exposure
chemistry exposure to some form of energy or both it results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as
chemistry as well with the system environment which may be designed vessels which are often laboratory glassware chemical reactions can result in
chemistry in the formation or dissociation of molecules that is molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules or rearrangement
chemistry rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds oxidation reduction dissociation
chemistry dissociation acid base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions a chemical reaction can
chemistry can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation while in a non nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms
chemistry atoms on both sides of the equation are equal for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles
chemistry particles viz protons and neutrons the sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in
chemistry in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism a chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in
chemistry in a number of steps each of which may have a different speed many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus
chemistry thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product
chemistry product mix of a reaction many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions several empirical
chemistry empirical rules like the woodward hoffmann rules often come handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction according to the
chemistry the iupac gold book a chemical reaction is a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species accordingly a chemical
chemistry chemical reaction may be an elementary reaction or a stepwise reaction an additional caveat is made in that this definition includes
chemistry includes cases where the interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as
chemistry as indicated by this definition but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular
chemistry molecular entities i e microscopic chemical events redox main article redox redox reduction oxidation reactions include all chemical reactions in which
chemistry which atoms have their oxidation state changed by either gaining electrons reduction or losing electrons oxidation substances that have the ability
chemistry ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing agents oxidants or oxidizers an oxidant
chemistry oxidant removes electrons from another substance similarly substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive
chemistry reductive and are known as reducing agents reductants or reducers a reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus oxidized
chemistry oxidized itself and because it donates electrons it is also called an electron donor oxidation and reduction properly refer to a
chemistry a change in oxidation number the actual transfer of electrons may never occur thus oxidation is better defined as an increase
chemistry increase in oxidation number and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number equilibrium main article chemical equilibrium although the concept of
chemistry of equilibrium is widely used across sciences in the context of chemistry it arises whenever a number of different states of
chemistry of the chemical composition are possible for example in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another
chemistry another or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase a system of chemical substances at
chemistry at equilibrium even though having an unchanging composition is most often not static molecules of the substances continue to react with
chemistry with one another thus giving rise to a dynamic equilibrium thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such
chemistry such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time energy main article energy in the context of chemistry energy is an attribute
chemistry attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic molecular or aggregate structure since a chemical transformation is accompanied by
chemistry by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease
chemistry decrease of energy of the substances involved some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in
chemistry in the form of heat or light thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the
chemistry the reactants a reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the
chemistry the initial state in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse a reaction is said to be exothermic
chemistry exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings in the case of endothermic reactions the reaction absorbs heat from the
chemistry the surroundings chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy the
chemistry the speed of a chemical reaction at given temperature t is related to the activation energy e by the boltzmann s
chemistry s population factor e e kt that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to
chemistry to e at the given temperature t this exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the arrhenius
chemistry arrhenius equation the activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat light electricity
chemistry electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound a related concept free energy which also incorporates entropy considerations is a
chemistry a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction
chemistry reaction in chemical thermodynamics a reaction is feasible only if the total change in the gibbs free energy is negative delta
chemistry delta g le if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at equilibrium there exist only
chemistry only limited possible states of energy for electrons atoms and molecules these are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics which
chemistry which require quantization of energy of a bound system the atoms molecules in a higher energy state are said to be
chemistry be excited the molecules atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive that is more amenable
chemistry amenable to chemical reactions the phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings
chemistry surroundings when the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome
chemistry overcome them it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water h o
chemistry o a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds whereas hydrogen sulfide h s is a
chemistry a gas at room temperature and standard pressure as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole dipole interactions the transfer of
chemistry of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance however heat
chemistry heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational
chemistry rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer thus because vibrational
chemistry vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels heat is more easily transferred between substances relative
chemistry relative to light or other forms of electronic energy for example ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy
chemistry efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy the existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances
chemistry substances is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral lines different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical
chemistry chemical spectroscopy e g ir microwave nmr esr etc spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects like
chemistry like stars and distant galaxies by analyzing their radiation spectra chemical reactions are governed by certain laws which have become fundamental

chemistry modern physics however special relativity shows that due to mass energy equivalence whenever non material energy heat light kinetic energy is
chemistry is removed from a non isolated system some mass will be lost with it high energy losses result in loss of
chemistry of weighable amounts of mass an important topic in nuclear chemistry law of definite composition although in many systems notably biomacromolecules

computers for artificial vision cambridge ma at last neuroscience is having an impact on computer science and artificial intelligence ai for the
computers the first time scientists in tomaso poggio s laboratory at the mcgovern institute for brain research at mit applied a computational
computers computational model of how the brain processes visual information to a complex real world task recognizing the objects in a busy
computers busy street scene the researchers were pleasantly surprised at the power of this new approach people have been talking about computers
computers computers imitating the brain for a long time said poggio who is also the eugene mcdermott professor in the department of
computers of brain and cognitive sciences and the co director of the center for biological and computational learning at mit that was
computers was alan turing s original motivation in the s but in the last years computer science and ai have developed independently
computers independently of neuroscience our work is biologically inspired computer science we developed a model of the visual system that was meant
computers meant to be useful for neuroscientists in designing and interpreting experiments but that also could be used for computer science said
computers said thomas serre a former phd student and now a post doctoral researcher in poggio s lab and lead author a
computers a paper about the street scene application in the ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence we chose street scene
computers scene recognition as an example because it has a restricted set of object categories and it has practical social applications near
computers near term applications include surveillance and automobile driver s assistance and eventually visual search engines biomedical imaging analysis robots with realistic
computers realistic vision on the neuroscience end this research is essential for designing augmented sensory prostheses such as one that could replicate
computers replicate the computations carried by damaged nerves from the retina and once you have a good model of how the human
computers human brain works serre explained you can break it to mimic a brain disorder one brain disorder that involves distortions in
computers in visual perception is schizophrenia but nobody understands the neurobiological basis for those distortions the versatility of the biological model turns
computers turns computer vision from a trick into something really useful said co author stanley bileschi a post doctoral researcher in the

computers of the computer science department at tel aviv university are working with the mit entrepreneur office the deshpande center in the
computers the sloan school this center helps mit students and professors bridge the gap between an intriguing idea or technology and a
computers a commercially viable concept recognizing scenes the ieee paper describes how the team showed the model randomly selected images so that
computers that it could learn to identify commonly occurring features in real word objects such as trees cars and people in so
computers so called supervised training sessions the model used those features to label by category the varied examples of objects found in
computers in digital photographs of street scenes buildings cars motorcycles airplanes faces pedestrians roads skies trees and leaves the photographs derive from
computers from a street scene database compiled by bileschi compared to traditional computer vision systems the biological model was surprisingly versatile traditional
computers traditional systems are engineered for specific object classes for instance systems engineered to detect faces or recognize textures are poor at
computers at detecting cars in the biological model the same algorithm can learn to detect widely different types of objects to test
computers test the model the team presented full street scenes consisting of previously unseen examples from the street scene database the model
computers model scanned the scene and based on its supervised training recognized the objects in the scene the upshot is that the
computers the model learned from examples which according to poggio is a hallmark of artificial intelligence modeling object recognition teaching a computer
computers computer how to recognize objects has been exceedingly difficult because a computer model has two paradoxical goals it needs to create
computers create a representation for a particular object that is very specific such as a horse as opposed to a cow or
computers or a unicorn at the same time the representation must be sufficiently invariant so as to discard meaningless changes in pose
computers pose illumination size position and many other variations in appearances even a child s brain handles these contradictory tasks easily in
computers in rapid object recognition pixel like information enters from the retina and passes in a fast feed forward bottom up sweep
computers sweep through the hierarchical architecture of the visual cortex what makes the poggio lab s model so innovative and powerful is
computers is that computationally speaking it mimics the brain s own hierarchy specifically the layers within the model replicate the way neurons
computers neurons process input and output stimuli according to neural recordings in physiological labs like the brain the model alternates several times
computers times between computations that help build an object representation that is increasingly invariant to changes in appearances of an object in
computers in the visual field and computations that help build an object representation that is increasingly complex and specific to a given
computers given object the model s success validates work in physiology labs that have measured the tuning properties of neurons throughout visual
computers visual cortex by necessity most of those experiments are made with simplistic artificial stimuli such as gratings bars and line drawings
computers drawings that bear little resemblance to real world images we put together a system that mimics as closely as possible how
computers how cortical cells respond to simple stimuli like the ones that are used in the physiology lab said serre the fact
computers fact that this system seems to work on realistic street scene images is a concept proof that the activity of neurons
computers neurons as measured in the lab is sufficient to explain how brains can perform complex recognition tasks making it more useful
computers useful the model used in the street scene application mimics only the computations the brain uses for rapid object recognition the
computers the lab is now elaborating the model to include the brain s feedback loops from the cognitive centers this slower form
computers form of object recognition provides time for context and reflection such as if i see a car it must be on
computers on the road not in the sky giving the model the ability to recognize such semantic features will empower it for
computers for broader applications including managing seemingly insurmountable amounts of data work tasks or even email the team is also working on

computers is the company mantra but true artificial intelligence not only has serious ethical and moral implications self aware intelligence may also
computers also not be controllable after all it thinks for itself and makes decisions based on that reasoning as we all do
computers do what if google creates ai with the logical reasoning neuroscientists at mit have developed a computer model that mimics the
computers the human vision system to accurately detect and recognize objects in a busy street scene such as cars and motorcycles such
computers such biologically inspired vision systems could soon be used in surveillance systems or in smart sensors that can warn drivers of
computers of pedestrians and other obstacles it may also help in the development of so called visual search engines says thomas serre
computers serre a neuroscientist at the center for biological and computational learning at mit s mcgovern institute for brain research who was
computers was involved in the project researchers have been interested for years in trying to copy biological vision systems simply because they
computers they are so good says david hogg a computer vision expert at leeds university in the uk this is a very
computers very successful example of mimicking biological vision he says teaching a computer to classify objects has proved much harder than was
computers was originally anticipated says serre who carried out the work with tomaso poggio codirector of the center on the one hand
computers hand to recognize a particular type of object such as a car a computer needs a template or computational representation specific
computers specific to that particular object such a template enables the computer to distinguish a car from objects in other classes noncars
computers noncars yet this representation must be sufficiently flexible to include all types of cars no matter how varied in appearance at
computers at different angles positions and poses and under different lighting conditions you want to be able to recognize an object anywhere
computers anywhere in the field of vision irrespective of where it is and irrespective of its size says serre yet if you
computers you analyze images just by their patterns of light and dark pixels then two portrait images of different people can end
computers end up looking more similar than two images of the same person taken from different angles the most effective method for
computers for getting around such problems is to train a learning algorithm on a set of images and allow it to extract
computers extract the features they have in common two wheels aligned with the road could signal a car for example serre and
computers and poggio believe that the human vision system uses a similar approach but one that depends on a hierarchy of successive
computers successive layers in the visual cortex the first layers of the cortex detect an object s simpler features such as edges
computers edges and higher layers integrate that information to form our perception of the object as a whole artificial intelligence wikipedia the

computers claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy
computers philosophy are there limits to how intelligent machines can be is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence
computers intelligence can a machine have a mind and consciousness a few of the most influential answers to these questions are given
computers given below turing s polite convention if a machine acts as intelligently as a human being then it is as intelligent
computers intelligent as a human being alan turing theorized that ultimately we can only judge the intelligence of a machine based on
computers on its behavior this theory forms the basis of the turing test the dartmouth proposal every aspect of learning or any
computers any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it this assertion
computers assertion was printed in the proposal for the dartmouth conference of and represents the position of most working ai researchers newell
computers newell and simon s physical symbol system hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent

computers a high priority for ai research human beings solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments rather than the conscious
computers conscious step by step deduction that early ai research was able to model ai has made some progress at imitating this

computers research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that gives rise to this skill knowledge representation main articles
computers articles knowledge representation and commonsense knowledge knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central to ai research many of the problems machines

computers are objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we
computers we know about what other people know and many other less well researched domains a complete representation of what exists is
computers is an ontology borrowing a word from traditional philosophy of which the most general are called upper ontologies among the most
computers most difficult problems in knowledge representation are default reasoning and the qualification problem many of the things people know take the
computers the form of working assumptions for example if a bird comes up in conversation people typically picture an animal that is
computers is fist sized sings and flies none of these things is true about all birds john mccarthy identified this problem in
computers in as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge
computers huge number of exceptions almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires ai research has
computers has explored a number of solutions to this problem the breadth of commonsense knowledge the number of atomic facts that the
computers the average person knows is astronomical research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge e g
computers g cyc require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time
computers time a major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources
computers sources like the internet and thus be able to add to its own ontology the subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge
computers knowledge much of what people know isn t represented as facts or statements that they could actually say out loud for
computers for example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed or an art critic can
computers can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake these are intuitions or tendencies that

computers for symbolic conscious knowledge as with the related problem of sub symbolic reasoning it is hoped that situated ai or computational
computers computational intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge planning main article automated planning and scheduling intelligent agents must
computers must be able to set goals and achieve them they need a way to visualize the future they must have a
computers a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it
computers it and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of the available choices in some planning problems
computers problems the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what
computers what the consequences of its actions may be however if this is not true it must periodically check if the world
computers world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty
computers uncertainty multi agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal emergent behavior such as
computers as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence learning main article machine learning machine learning has been central to
computers to ai research from the beginning unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input supervised learning
computers learning includes both classification be able to determine what category something belongs in after seeing a number of examples of things
computers things from several categories and regression given a set of numerical input output examples discover a continuous function that would generate
computers generate the outputs from the inputs in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones
computers ones these can be analyzed in terms of decision theory using concepts like utility the mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms

computers and others more exotic to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input a few
computers few selected subproblems are speech recognition facial recognition and object recognition social intelligence main article affective computing kismet a robot with
computers with rudimentary social skills emotion and social skills play two roles for an intelligent agent it must be able to predict
computers predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states this involves elements of game theory decision theory as
computers as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions for good human computer interaction
computers interaction an intelligent machine also needs to display emotions at the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the
computers the humans it interacts with at best it should have normal emotions itself creativity main article computational creativity topio a robot
computers robot that can play ping pong developed by tosy a sub field of ai addresses creativity both theoretically from a philosophical
computers philosophical and psychological perspective and practically via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative general intelligence
computers intelligence main articles strong ai and ai complete most researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine
computers machine with general intelligence known as strong ai combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all
computers all of them a few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such
computers such a project many of the problems above are considered ai complete to solve one problem you must solve them all
computers all for example even a straightforward specific task like machine translation requires that the machine the author s argument reason know
computers know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the author s intention social intelligence machine translation therefore is believed
computers believed to be ai complete it may require strong ai to be done as well as humans can do it approaches
computers approaches to ai there is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides ai research researchers disagree about many issues a
computers a few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by
computers by studying psychology or neurology or is human biology as irrelevant to ai research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering
computers engineering can intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization or does it necessarily require solving
computers solving a large number of completely unrelated problems can intelligence be reproduced using high level symbols similar to words and ideas
computers ideas or does it require sub symbolic processing cybernetics and brain simulation main articles cybernetics and computational neuroscience the human brain
computers brain provides inspiration for artificial intelligence researchers however there is no consensus on how closely it should be simulated in the
computers the s and s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology information theory and cybernetics some of them built
computers built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as w grey walter s turtles and the johns hopkins
computers hopkins beast many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the teleological society at princeton university and the ratio club in
computers in england by this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the s traditional symbolic ai
computers ai main article good old fashioned artificial intelligence when access to digital computers became possible in the middle s ai research
computers research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation the research was centered in three
computers three institutions cmu stanford and mit and each one developed its own style of research john haugeland named these approaches to
computers to ai good old fashioned ai or gofai cognitive simulation economist herbert simon and alan newell studied human problem solving skills
computers skills and attempted to formalize them and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence as well as
computers as cognitive science operations research and management science their research team performed psychological experiments to demonstrate the similarities between human problem
computers problem solving and the programs such as their general problem solver they were developing this tradition centered at carnegie mellon university
computers university would eventually culminate in the development of the soar architecture in the middle s logical ai unlike newell and simon
computers simon john mccarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought but should instead try to find the essence
computers essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving regardless of whether people used the same algorithms his laboratory at stanford sail focused
computers focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems including knowledge representation planning and learning logic was also
computers also focus of the work at the university of edinburgh and elsewhere in europe which led to the development of the
computers the language prolog and the science of logic scruffy symbolic ai researchers at mit such as marvin minsky and seymour papert
computers papert found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad hoc solutions they argued that there was
computers was no simple and general principle like logic that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior roger schank described their
computers their anti logic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms at cmu and stanford commonsense knowledge bases such as
computers as doug lenat s cyc are an example of scruffy ai since they must be built by hand one complicated concept
computers concept at a time knowledge based ai when computers with large memories became available around researchers from all three traditions began
computers began to build knowledge into ai applications this knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of expert systems introduced by
computers by edward feigenbaum the first truly successful form of ai software the knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that
computers that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple ai applications sub symbolic ai during the s symbolic approaches
computers approaches had achieved great success at simulating high level thinking in small demonstration programs approaches based on cybernetics or neural networks
computers networks were abandoned or pushed into the background by the s however progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many
computers many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning
computers learning and pattern recognition a number of researchers began to look into sub symbolic approaches to specific ai problems bottom up
computers up embodied situated behavior based or nouvelle ai researchers from the related field of robotics such as rodney brooks rejected symbolic
computers symbolic ai and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive their work revived the
computers the non symbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the s and reintroduced the use of control theory in ai
computers ai these approaches are also conceptually related to the embodied mind thesis computational intelligence interest in neural networks and connectionism was
computers was revived by david rumelhart and others in the middle s these and other sub symbolic approaches such as fuzzy systems
computers systems and evolutionary computation are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence statistical ai in the s ai
computers ai researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems these tools are truly scientific in the sense that their results
computers results are both measurable and verifiable and they have been responsible for many of ai s recent successes the shared mathematical
computers mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or operations research russell
computers russell norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats integrating the approaches intelligent
computers intelligent agent paradigm an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and actions which maximizes its chances of success
computers success the simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems the most complicated intelligent agents are rational thinking human beings
computers beings the paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful without agreeing
computers agreeing on one single approach an agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works some agents are
computers are symbolic and logical some are sub symbolic neural networks and others may use new approaches the paradigm also gives researchers
computers researchers a common language to communicate with other fields such as decision theory and economics that also use concepts of abstract
computers abstract agents the intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the s an agent architecture or cognitive architecture researchers have designed
computers designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi agent system a system with both symbolic
computers symbolic and sub symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system and the study of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration
computers integration a hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub symbolic ai at its lowest reactive levels and traditional symbolic ai
computers ai at its highest levels where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling rodney brooks subsumption architecture was an early
computers early proposal for such a hierarchical system tools of ai research in the course of years of research ai has developed
computers developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science a few of the most general
computers general of these methods are discussed below search and optimization main articles search algorithm optimization mathematics and evolutionary computation many problems
computers problems in ai can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions reasoning can be reduced to performing
computers performing a search for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions
computers conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting
computers attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called means ends analysis robotics algorithms for moving limbs and
computers and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization simple exhaustive searches
computers searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to
computers to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes the solution for many problems is
computers is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal called pruning
computers pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with a best guess for what path the solution lies on a very
computers very different kind of search came to prominence in the s based on the mathematical theory of optimization for many problems
computers problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until
computers until no more refinements can be made these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at
computers at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we
computers we reach the top other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization evolutionary computation uses a form of
computers of optimization search for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate
computers mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses forms of evolutionary computation include swarm intelligence
computers intelligence algorithms such as ant colony or particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms and genetic logic main
computers main articles logic and automated reasoning logic was introduced into ai research by john mccarthy in his advice taker proposal in
computers in j alan robinson discovered a simple complete and entirely algorithmic method for logical deduction which can easily be performed by
computers by digital computers however a naive implementation of the algorithm quickly leads to a combinatorial explosion or an infinite loop in
computers in robert kowalski suggested representing logical expressions as horn clauses statements in the form of rules if p then q which
computers which reduced logical deduction to backward chaining or forward chaining this greatly alleviated but did not eliminate the problem logic is
computers is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well for example the
computers the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and inductive logic is a method for learning there are several different forms of
computers of logic used in ai research propositional or sentential logic is the logic of statements which can be true or false
computers false first order logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and
computers and their relations with each other fuzzy logic a version of first order logic which allows the truth of a statement
computers statement to be represented as a value between and rather than simply true or false fuzzy systems can be used for
computers for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems default logics non monotonic logics
computers logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem several extensions of logic
computers logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus
computers calculus for representing events and time causal calculus belief calculus and modal logics probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning main articles bayesian
computers bayesian network hidden markov model kalman filter decision theory and utility theory many problems in ai in reasoning planning learning perception
computers perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information starting in the late s and early s
computers s judea pearl and others championed the use of methods drawn from probability theory and economics to devise a number of
computers of powerful tools to solve these problems bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for a large
computers large number of problems reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectation maximization algorithm planning using decision networks and
computers and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams
computers streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time e g hidden markov models or kalman filters
computers filters a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent
computers intelligent agent precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory
computers theory decision analysis information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and
computers and mechanism design classifiers and statistical learning methods main articles classifier mathematics statistical classification and machine learning the simplest ai applications
computers applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up controllers do
computers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems classifiers are
computers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match they can be tuned according to examples making them very
computers very attractive for use in ai these examples are known as observations or patterns in supervised learning each pattern belongs to
computers to a certain predefined class a class can be seen as a decision that has to be made all the observations
computers observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is
computers is classified based on previous experience a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning
computers learning approaches a wide range of classifiers are available each with its strengths and weaknesses classifier performance depends greatly on the
computers the characteristics of the data to be classified there is no single classifier that works best on all given problems this
computers this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem various empirical tests have been performed to compare classifier performance
computers performance and to find the characteristics of data that determine classifier performance determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is
computers is however still more an art than science the most widely used classifiers are the neural network kernel methods such as
computers as the support vector machine k nearest neighbor algorithm gaussian mixture model naive bayes classifier and decision tree the performance of
computers of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of classification tasks in order to find data characteristics that determine
computers determine classifier performance neural networks main articles neural networks and connectionism a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin
computers akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain the study of artificial neural networks began in the decade
computers decade before the field ai research was founded in the s frank rosenblatt developed an important early version the perceptron paul
computers paul werbos developed the backpropagation algorithm for multilayer perceptrons in which led to a renaissance in neural network research and connectionism
computers connectionism in general in the middle s the hopfield net a form of attractor network was first described by john hopfield
computers hopfield in common network architectures which have been developed include the feedforward neural network the radial basis network the kohonen self
computers self organizing map and various recurrent neural networks citation needed neural networks are applied to the problem of learning using such
computers such techniques as hebbian learning competitive learning and the relatively new architectures of hierarchical temporal memory and deep belief networks control
computers control theory main article intelligent control control theory the grandchild of cybernetics has many important applications especially in robotics specialized languages
computers languages ai researchers have developed several specialized languages for ai research ipl was the first language developed for artificial intelligence it
computers it includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving including lists associations schemas frames dynamic memory allocation
computers allocation data types recursion associative retrieval functions as arguments generators streams and cooperative multitasking lisp is a practical mathematical notation for
computers for computer programs based on lambda calculus linked lists are one of lisp languages major data structures and lisp source code
computers code is itself made up of lists as a result lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure giving
computers giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new domain specific languages embedded in
computers in lisp there are many dialects of lisp in use today prolog is a declarative language where programs are expressed in
computers in terms of relations and execution occurs by running queries over these relations prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning database
computers database and language parsing applications prolog is widely used in ai today strips is a language for expressing automated planning problem
computers problem instances it expresses an initial state the goal states and a set of actions for each action preconditions what must
computers must be established before the action is performed and postconditions what is established after the action is performed are specified planner
computers planner is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages it gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted
computers interpreted with pattern directed inference ai applications are also often in standard languages like c and languages designed for mathematics such
computers such as matlab and lush evaluating artificial intelligence main article progress in artificial intelligence how can one determine if an agent
computers agent is intelligent in alan turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the
computers the turing test this procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested however it is a
computers a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as
computers as small problems in chemistry hand writing recognition and game playing such tests have been termed subject matter expert turing tests
computers tests smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever increasing number of positive results the broad classes of
computers of outcome for an ai test are optimal it is not possible to perform better strong super human performs better than
computers than all humans super human performs better than most humans sub human performs worse than most humans for example performance at
computers at checkers draughts is optimal performance at chess is super human and nearing strong super human and performance at many everyday
computers everyday tasks performed by humans is sub human a quite different approach is based on measuring machine intelligence through tests which
computers which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence examples of this kind of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence
computers intelligence tests using notions from kolmogorov complexity and compression similar definitions of machine intelligence have been put forward by marcus hutter
computers hutter in his book universal artificial intelligence springer which was further developed by legg and hutter mathematical definitions have as one
computers one advantage that they could be applied to nonhuman intelligences and in the absence of human testers ai research is a
computers a leading artificial intelligence research project at ai we re creating a new form of life our expanding web site is
computers is an essential part of the emerging global discussion about artificial intelligence on this website we showcase the state of the
computers the art in pattern matching conversational machines demonstrated by alan and in reinforcement learning algorithms demonstrated by hal use our forums
computers forums original papers online labs demos and links to explore what s happening both at ai the project and in ai
computers ai if one were to rank a list of civilization s greatest and most elusive intellectual challenges the problem of decoding
computers decoding ourselves understanding the inner workings of our minds and our brains and how the architecture of these elements is encoded
computers encoded in our genome would surely be at the top yet the diverse fields that took on this challenge from philosophy
computers philosophy and psychology to computer science and neuroscience have been fraught with disagreement about the right approach in the computer scientist
computers scientist john mccarthy coined the term artificial intelligence ai to describe the study of intelligence by implementing its essential features on
computers on a computer instantiating an intelligent system using man made hardware rather than our own biological hardware of cells and tissues
computers tissues would show ultimate understanding and have obvious practical applications in the creation of intelligent devices or even robots some of
computers of mccarthy s colleagues in neighboring departments however were more interested in how intelligence is implemented in humans and other animals
computers animals first noam chomsky and others worked on what became cognitive science a field aimed at uncovering the mental representations and
computers and rules that underlie our perceptual and cognitive abilities chomsky and his colleagues had to overthrow the then dominant paradigm of
computers of behaviorism championed by harvard psychologist b f skinner where animal behavior was reduced to a simple set of associations between
computers between an action and its subsequent reward or punishment the undoing of skinner s grip on psychology is commonly marked by
computers by chomsky s critical review of skinner s book verbal behavior a book in which skinner attempted to explain linguistic ability
computers ability using behaviorist principles skinner s approach stressed the historical associations between a stimulus and the animal s response an approach
computers approach easily framed as a kind of empirical statistical analysis predicting the future as a function of the past chomsky s
computers s conception of language on the other hand stressed the complexity of internal representations encoded in the genome and their maturation
computers maturation in light of the right data into a sophisticated computational system one that cannot be usefully broken down into a
computers a set of associations behaviorist principles of associations could not explain the richness of linguistic knowledge our endlessly creative use of
computers of it or how quickly children acquire it with only minimal and imperfect exposure to language presented by their environment the
computers the language faculty as chomsky referred to it was part of the organism s genetic endowment much like the visual system
computers system the immune system and the circulatory system and we ought to approach it just as we approach these other more
computers more down to earth biological systems david marr a neuroscientist colleague of chomsky s at mit defined a general framework for
computers for studying complex biological systems like the brain in his influential book vision one that chomsky s analysis of the language
computers language capacity more or less fits into according to marr a complex biological system can be understood at three distinct levels
computers levels the first level computational level describes the input and output to the system which define the task the system is
computers is performing in the case of the visual system the input might be the image projected on our retina and the
computers the output might our brain s identification of the objects present in the image we had observed the second level algorithmic
computers algorithmic level describes the procedure by which an input is converted to an output i e how the image on our
computers our retina can be processed to achieve the task described by the computational level finally the third level implementation level describes
computers describes how our own biological hardware of cells implements the procedure described by the algorithmic level the approach taken by chomsky
computers chomsky and marr toward understanding how our minds achieve what they do is as different as can be from behaviorism the
computers the emphasis here is on the internal structure of the system that enables it to perform a task rather than on
computers on external association between past behavior of the system and the environment the goal is to dig into the black box
computers box that drives the system and describe its inner workings much like how a computer scientist would explain how a cleverly
computers cleverly designed piece of software works and how it can be executed on a desktop computer as today the history of
computers of cognitive science is a story of the unequivocal triumph of an essentially chomskyian approach over skinner s behaviorist paradigm an
computers an achievement commonly referred to as the cognitive revolution though chomsky himself rejects this term while this may be a relatively
computers relatively accurate depiction in cognitive science and psychology behaviorist thinking is far from dead in related disciplines behaviorist experimental paradigms and
computers and associationist explanations for animal behavior are used routinely by neuroscientists who aim to study the neurobiology of behavior in laboratory
computers laboratory animals such as rodents where the systematic three level framework advocated by marr is not applied in may of last
computers last year during the th anniversary of the massachusetts institute of technology a symposium on brains minds and machines took place
computers place where leading computer scientists psychologists and neuroscientists gathered to discuss the past and future of artificial intelligence and its connection
computers connection to the neurosciences the gathering was meant to inspire multidisciplinary enthusiasm for the revival of the scientific question from which
computers which the field of artificial intelligence originated how does intelligence work how does our brain give rise to our cognitive abilities
computers abilities and could this ever be implemented in a machine noam chomsky speaking in the symposium wasn t so enthused chomsky
computers chomsky critiqued the field of ai for adopting an approach reminiscent of behaviorism except in more modern computationally sophisticated form chomsky
computers chomsky argued that the field s heavy use of statistical techniques to pick regularities in masses of data is unlikely to
computers to yield the explanatory insight that science ought to offer for chomsky the new ai focused on using statistical learning techniques
computers techniques to better mine and predict data is unlikely to yield general principles about the nature of intelligent beings or about
computers about cognition this critique sparked an elaborate reply to chomsky from google s director of research and noted ai researcher peter
computers peter norvig who defended the use of statistical models and argued that ai s new methods and definition of progress is
computers is not far off from what happens in the other sciences chomsky acknowledged that the statistical approach might have practical value
computers value just as in the example of a useful search engine and is enabled by the advent of fast computers capable
computers capable of processing massive data but as far as a science goes chomsky would argue it is inadequate or more harshly
computers harshly kind of shallow we wouldn t have taught the computer much about what the phrase physicist sir isaac newton really
computers really means even if we can build a search engine that returns sensible hits to users who type the phrase in
computers in artificial intelligence ai would be the possession of intelligence or the exercise of thought by machines such as computers philosophically
computers philosophically the main ai question is can there be such or as alan turing put it can a machine think what
computers what makes this a philosophical and not just a scientific and technical question is the scientific recalcitrance of the concept of
computers of intelligence or thought and its moral religious and legal significance in european and other traditions moral and legal standing depend
computers depend not just on what is outwardly done but also on inward states of mind only rational individuals have standing as
computers as moral agents and status as moral patients subject to certain harms such as being betrayed only sentient individuals are subject
computers subject to certain other harms such as pain and suffering since computers give every outward appearance of performing intellectual tasks the
computers the question arises are they really thinking and if they are really thinking are they not then owed similar rights to
computers to rational human beings many fictional explorations of ai in literature and film explore these very questions a complication arises if
computers if humans are animals and if animals are themselves machines as scientific biology supposes still we wish to exclude from the
computers the machines in question men born in the usual manner alan turing or even in unusual manners such as in vitro
computers vitro fertilization or ectogenesis and if nonhuman animals think we wish to exclude them from the machines too more particularly the
computers the ai thesis should be understood to hold that thought or intelligence can be produced by artificial means made not grown
computers grown for brevity s sake we will take machine to denote just the artificial ones since the present interest in thinking
computers thinking machines has been aroused by a particular kind of machine an electronic computer or digital computer present controversies regarding claims
computers claims of artificial intelligence center on these accordingly the scientific discipline and engineering enterprise of ai has been characterized as the
computers the attempt to discover and implement the computational means to make machines behave in ways that would be called intelligent if
computers if a human were so behaving john mccarthy or to make them do things that would require intelligence if done by
computers by men marvin minsky these standard formulations duck the question of whether deeds which indicate intelligence when done by humans truly
computers truly indicate it when done by machines that s the philosophical question so called weak ai grants the fact or prospect
computers prospect of intelligent acting machines strong ai says these actions can be real intelligence strong ai says some artificial computation is
computers is thought computationalism says that all thought is computation though many strong ai advocates are computationalists these are logically independent claims
computers claims some artificial computation being thought is consistent with some thought not being computation contra computationalism all thought being computation is
computers is consistent with some computation and perhaps all artificial computation not being thought the turing test while we don t know
computers know what thought or intelligence is essentially and while we re very far from agreed on what things do and don
computers don t have it almost everyone agrees that humans think and agrees with descartes that our intelligence is amply manifest in
computers in our speech along these lines alan turing suggested that if computers showed human level conversational abilities we should by that
computers that be amply assured of their intelligence turing proposed a specific conversational test for human level intelligence the turing test it
computers it has come to be called turing himself characterizes this test in terms of an imitation game turing p whose original
computers original version is played by three people a man a a woman b and an interrogator c who may be of
computers of either sex the interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two the object of the game for the
computers the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman the interrogator is
computers is allowed to put questions to a and b by teletype to avoid visual and auditory clues it is a s
computers s object in the game to try and cause c to make the wrong identification the object of the game for
computers for the third player b is to help the interrogator turing continues we may now ask the question what will happen
computers happen when a machine the part of a in this game will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game
computers game is being played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman these

computers with multivariate i e high dimensional probablity densities here s where you can review things like expectations covariance matrices independence marginal
computers marginal distributions and conditional distributions once you re happy with this stuff you won t be a data miner but you
computers you ll have the tools to very quickly become one gaussians gaussians both the friendly univariate kind and the slightly reticent
computers reticent but nice when you get to know them multivariate kind are extremely useful in many parts of statistical data mining
computers mining including many data mining models in which the underlying data assumption is highly non gaussian you need to be friend
computers friend with multivariate gaussians maximum likelihood estimation mle is a solid tool for learning parameters of a data mining model it
computers it is a methodlogy which tries to do two things first it is a reasonably well principled way to work out
computers out what computation you should be doing when you want to learn some kinds of model from data second it is
computers is often fairly computationally tractable in any case the important thing is that in order to understand things like polynomial regression
computers regression neural nets mixture models hidden markov models and many other things it s going to really help if you re
computers re happy with mle gaussian bayes classifiers once you are friends with gaussians it it easy to use them as subcomponents
computers subcomponents of bayesian classifiers this tutorial show you how cross validation cross validation is one of several approaches to estimating how
computers how well the model you ve just learned from some training data is going to perform on future as yet unseen
computers unseen data we ll review testset validation leave one one cross validation loocv and k fold cross validation and we ll
computers ll discuss a wide variety of places that these techniques can be used we ll also discuss overfitting the terrible phenomenon
computers phenomenon that cv is supposed to present and at the end our hairs will stand on end as we realize that
computers that even when using cv you can still overfit arbitrarily badly neural networks we begin by talking about linear regression the
computers the ancestor of neural nets we look at how linear regression can use simple matrix operations to learn from data we
computers we gurgle with delight as we see why one initial assumption leads inevitably to the decision to try to minimize sum
computers sum squared error we then explore an alternative way to compute linear parameters gradient descent and then we exploit gradient descent
computers descent to allow classifiers in addition to regressors and finally to allow highly non linear models full neural nets in all
computers all their glory instance based learning aka case based or memory based or non parametric over a century old this form
computers form of data mining is still being used very intensively by statisticians and machine learners alike we explore nearest neighbor learning
computers learning k nearest neighbor kernel methods and locally weighted polynomial regression software and data for the algorithms in this tutorial are
computers are available from http www cs cmu edu awm vizier the example figures in this slide set were created with the
computers the same software and data eight regression algorithms you ll have to wait to find out andrew s ordering on them
computers them but based on all the foundations you ve covered so far we will quickly be able to run through regression
computers regression trees cascade correlation group method data handling gmdh multivariate adaptive regression splines mars multilinear interpolation radial basis functions robust regression
computers regression cascade correlation projection pursuit predicting real valued outputs an introduction to regression this lecture is made up entirely from material
computers material from the start of the neural nets lecture and a subset of the topics in the favorite regression algorithms lecture
computers lecture we talk about linear regression and then these topics varying noise non linear regression very briefly polynomial regression radial basis
computers basis functions robust regression regression trees multilinear interpolation and mars bayesian networks the tutorial first reviews the fundamentals of probability but
computers but to do that properly please see the earlier andrew lectures on probability for data mining it then discusses the use
computers use of joint distributions for representing and reasoning about uncertain knowledge having discussed the obvious drawback the curse of dimensionality for
computers for joint distributions as a general tool we visit the world of clever tricks involving indepedence and conditional independence that allow
computers allow us to express our uncertain knowledge much more succinctly and then we beam with pleasure as we realize we ve
computers ve got most of the knowledge we need to understand and appreciate bayesian networks already the remainder of the tutorial introduces
computers introduces the important question of how to do inference with bayesian networks see also the next andrew lecture for that inference
computers inference in bayesian networks by scott davies and andrew moore the majority of these slides were conceived and created by scott
computers scott davies scottd cs cmu edu once you ve got hold of a bayesian network there remains the question of how
computers how you do inference with it inference is the operation in which some subset of the attributes are given to us
computers us with known values and we must use the bayes net to the probability distribution of one or more of the
computers the remaining attributes a typical use of inference is i ve got a temperature of i m a year old male
computers male and my tongue feels kind of funny but i have no headache what s the chance that i ve got
computers got bubonic plague learning bayesian networks this short and simple tutorial overviews the problem of learning bayesian networks from data and
computers and the approaches that are used this is an area of active research by many research group including andrew and his
computers his students see the auton lab website for more details a short intro to naive bayesian classifiers i recommend using probability
computers probability for data mining for a more in depth introduction to density estimation and general use of bayes classifiers with naive
computers naive bayes classifiers as a special case but if you just want the executive summary bottom line on learning and using
computers using naive bayes classifiers on categorical attributes then these are the slides for you short overview of bayes nets this is
computers is a very short minute executive overview of the intuition and insight behind bayesian networks read the full bayes net tutorial
computers tutorial for more information gaussian mixture models gaussian mixture models gmms are among the most statistically mature methods for clustering though
computers though they are also used intensively for density estimation in this tutorial we introduce the concept of clustering and see how
computers how one form of clustering in which we assume that individual datapoints are generated by first choosing one of a set
computers set of multivariate gaussians and then sampling from them can be a well defined computational operation we then see how to
computers to learn such a thing from data and we discover that an optimization approach not used in any of the previous
computers previous andrew tutorials can help considerably here this optimization method is called expectation maximization em we ll spend some time giving
computers giving a few high level explanations and demonstrations of em which turns out to be valuable for many other algorithms beyond
computers beyond gaussian mixture models we ll meet em again in the later andrew tutorial on hidden markov models the wild n
computers n crazy algebra mentioned in the text can be found hand here k means and hierarchical clustering k means is the
computers the most famous clustering algorithm in this tutorial we review just what it is that clustering is trying to achieve and
computers and we show the detailed reason that the k means approach is cleverly optimizing something very meaningful oh yes and we
computers we ll tell you and show you what the k means algorithm actually does you ll also learn about another famous
computers famous class of clusterers hierarchical methods much beloved in the life sciences phrases like hierarchical agglomerative clustering and single linkage clustering
computers clustering will be bandied about hidden markov models in this tutorial we ll begin by reviewing markov models aka markov chains
computers chains and then we ll hide them this simulates a very common phenomenon there is some underlying dynamic system running along
computers along according to simple and uncertain dynamics but we can t see it all we can see are some noisy signals
computers signals arising from the underlying system from those noisy observations we want to do things like predict the most likely underlying
computers underlying system state or the time history of states or the likelihood of the next observation this has applications in fault
computers fault diagnosis robot localization computational biology speech understanding and many other areas in the tutorial we will describe how to happily
computers happily play with the mostly harmless math surrounding hmms and how to use a heart warming and simple to implement approach
computers approach called dynamic dp to efficiently do most of the hmm computations you could ever want to do these operations include
computers include state estimation estimating the most likely path of underlying states and and a grand and em filled finale learning hmms
computers hmms from data vc dimension this tutorial concerns a well known piece of machine learning theory if you ve got a
computers a learning algorithm in one hand and a dataset in the other hand to what extent can you decide whether the
computers the learning algorithm is in danger of overfitting or underfitting if you want to put some formal analysis into the fascinating
computers fascinating question of how overfitting can happen then this is the tutorial for you in addition to getting good understanding of
computers of the overfitting phenomenon you also end up with a method for estimating how well an algorithm will perform on future
computers future data that is solely based on its training set error and a property vc dimension of the learning algorithm vc
computers vc dimension thus gives an alternative to cross validation called structural risk minimization srm for choosing classifiers we ll discuss that
computers that we ll also very briefly compare both cv and srm to two other model selection methods aic and bic support
computers support vector machines we review the idea of the margin of a classifier and why that may be a good criterion
computers criterion for measuring a classifier s desirability then we consider the computational problem of finding the largest margin linear classifier at
computers at this point we look at our toes with embarassment and note that we have only done work applicable to noise
computers noise free data but we cheer up and show how to create a noise resistant classifier and then a non linear
computers linear classifier we then look under a microscope at the two things svms are renowned for the computational ability to survive
computers survive projecting data into a trillion dimensions and the statistical ability to survive what at first sight looks like a classic
computers classic overfitting trap pac learning pac stands for probably approximately correct and concerns a nice formalism for deciding how much data
computers data you need to collect in order for a given classifier to achieve a given probability of correct predictions on a
computers a given fraction of future test data the resulting is somewhat conservative but still represents an interesting avenue by which computer
computers computer science has tried to muscle in on the kind of analytical problem that you would normally find in a statistics
computers statistics department markov decision processes how do you plan efficiently if the results of your actions are uncertain there is some
computers some remarkably good news and some some significant computational hardship we begin by discussing markov systems which have no actions and
computers and the notion of markov systems with rewards we then motivate and explain the idea of infinite horizon discounted future rewards
computers rewards and then we look at two competing approaches to deal with the ing computational problem given a markov system with
computers with rewards compute the expected long term discounted rewards the two methods which usually sit at opposite corners of the ring
computers ring and snarl at each other are straight linear algebra and dynamic we then make the leap up to markov decision
computers decision processes and find that we ve already done of the work needed to compute not only the long term rewards
computers rewards of each mdp state but also the optimal action to take in each state in addition to these slides for

computers decision process and reinforcement learning algorithms by rohit kelkar and vivek mehta reinforcement learning you need to be happy about markov
computers markov decision processes the previous andrew tutorial before venturing into reinforcement learning it concerns the fascinating question of whether you can
computers can train a controller to perform optimally in a world where it may be necessary to suck up some short term
computers term punishment in order to achieve long term reward we will discuss certainty equivalent rl the temporal difference td learning and

computers finite deterministic games of perfect information we also practice saying that noun phrase in a single breath after the recovery teams
computers teams have done their job we talk about solving such games with minimax and then alpha beta search we also discuss
computers discuss the dynamic approach used most commonly for end games we also debate the theory and practice of heuristic evaluation functions
computers functions in games zero sum game theory want to know how and why to bluff in poker how games can be
computers be compiled down to a matrix form and general discussion of the basics of games of hidden information then these are

computers of items numbering into the hundreds or thousands as the story always goes we got older our collections got smaller and
computers and eventually our interests died out until now there are currently organizations around the world in the business of amassing collections
computers collections of things and their collections number into and above the trillions in many cases these collections or databases consist of
computers of items we use every day in this list we cover the top largest databases in the world library of not

computers publication meaning that youtube s database size has potentially more than doubled in the last s estimating the size of youtube
computers youtube s database is particularly difficult due to the varying sizes and lengths of each video however if one were truly
computers truly ambitious and a bit forgiving we could project that the youtube database will expect to grow as much as terabytes
computers terabytes of data in the next given videos per day x days per videos per terabyte megabytes if we assume that
computers that each video has a size of mb youtube would expect to grow terabytes next similarly if we assume that each

computers bayesian and neural networks for diagnosis prognosis applications in meteorology and climate data mining is the process of extracting nontrivial and
computers and potentially useful information or knowlege from the enormous data sets available in experimental sciences historical records reanalysis gcm simulations etc
computers etc providing explicit information that has a readable form and can be used to solve diagnosis classification or forecasting problems traditionally
computers traditionally these problems were solved by direct hands on data analysis using standard statistical methods but the increasing volume of data
computers data has motivated the study of automatic data analysis using more complex and sophisticated tools which can operate directly from data
computers data thus data mining identifies trends within data that go beyond simple analysis modern data mining techniques association rules decision trees
computers trees gaussian mixture models regression algorithms neural networks support vector machines bayesian networks etc are used in many domains to solve
computers solve association classification segmentation diagnosis and prediction problems among the different data mining algorithms probabilistic graphical models in particular bayesian networks
computers networks is a sound and powerful methodology grounded on probability and statistics which allows building tractable joint probabilistic models that represents
computers represents the relevant dependencies among a set of variables hundreds of variables in real life applications the resulting models allow for
computers for efficient probabilistic inference for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between large scale synoptic fields and local
computers local observation records providing a new methodology for probabilstic downscaling i e allowing to compute p observation large scale prediction for
computers for instance the red dots in the figure below correspond to the grid nodes of a gcm whereas the blue dots
computers dots correspond to a network of stations with historical records the links show the relevant dependencies automatically discovered from data formally
computers formally bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs whose nodes represent variables and whose arcs encode conditional independencies between the variables the
computers the graph provides an intuitive description of the dependency model and defines a simple factorization of the joint probability distribution leading
computers leading to a tractable model which is compatible with the encoded dependencies efficient algorithms exist to learn both the graphical and
computers and the probabilistic models from data thus allowing for the automatic application of this methodogy in complex problems bayesian networks that
computers that model sequences of variables such as for example time series of historical records are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of
computers of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams on the other hand neural
computers neural networks are nonlinear models inspired in the functioning of the brain which have been designed to solve different problems thus
computers thus multi layer perceptrons are regression like algorithms to build a deterministic model y f x relating a set of predictors
computers predictors x and predictands y figure below left self organizing maps som are competitive networks designed for clustering and visualization purposes
computers purposes data mining the analysis step of the knowledge in databases process or kdd an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science is
computers is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence machine learning
computers learning statistics and database systems the overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set
computers set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use aside from the raw analysis step it involves database and
computers and data management aspects data pre processing model and inference considerations interestingness metrics complexity considerations post processing of discovered structures visualization
computers visualization and online updating the term is a buzzword and is frequently misused to mean any form of large scale data
computers data or information processing collection extraction warehousing analysis and statistics but is also generalized to any kind of computer decision support
computers support system including artificial intelligence machine learning and business intelligence in the proper use of the word the key term is
computers is citation needed commonly defined as detecting something new even the popular book data mining practical machine learning tools and techniques
computers techniques with java which covers mostly machine learning material was originally to be named just practical machine learning and the term
computers term data mining was only added for marketing reasons often the more general terms large scale data analysis or analytics or
computers or when referring to actual methods artificial intelligence and machine learning are more appropriate the actual data mining task is the
computers the automatic or semi automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of
computers of data records cluster analysis unusual records anomaly detection and dependencies association rule mining this usually involves using database techniques such
computers such as spatial indices these patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data and may
computers may be used in further analysis or for example in machine learning and predictive analytics for example the data mining step
computers step might identify multiple groups in the data which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a
computers a decision support system neither the data collection data preparation nor result interpretation and reporting are part of the data mining
computers mining step but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional steps the related terms data dredging data fishing and
computers and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that
computers that are or may be too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered
computers discovered these methods can however be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations in the s
computers s statisticians used terms like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing
computers analyzing data without an a priori hypothesis the term data mining appeared around in the database community at the beginning of
computers of the century there was a phrase database mining trademarked by hnc a san diego based company now merged into fico
computers fico to pitch their data mining workstation researchers consequently turned to data mining other terms used include data archaeology information harvesting
computers harvesting information knowledge extraction etc gregory piatetsky shapiro coined the term knowledge in databases for the first workshop on the same
computers same topic and this term became more popular in ai and machine learning community however the term data mining became more

computers with the stages selection pre processing transformation data mining interpretation evaluation it exists however in many variations on this theme such
computers such as the cross industry standard process for data mining crisp dm which defines six phases business understanding data understanding data
computers data preparation modeling evaluation deployment before data mining algorithms can be used a target data set must be assembled as data
computers data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data the target data set must be large enough to contain
computers contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit a common source for data is
computers is a data mart or data warehouse pre processing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining the
computers the target set is then cleaned data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data data mining involves
computers involves six common classes of tasks anomaly detection outlier change deviation detection the identification of unusual data records that might be
computers be interesting or data errors that require further investigation association rule learning dependency modeling searches for relationships between variables for example
computers example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits using association rule learning the supermarket can determine which products are
computers are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes this is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis clustering
computers clustering is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another similar without
computers without using known structures in the data classification is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data for
computers for example an e mail program might attempt to classify an e mail as legitimate or as spam regression attempts to
computers to find a function which models the data with the least error summarization providing a more compact representation of the data
computers data set including visualization and report generation results validation data mining can unintentionally be misused and can then produce results which
computers which appear to be significant but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be reproduced on a new sample
computers sample of data and bear little use often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis
computers hypothesis testing a simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting but the same problem can arise
computers arise at different phases of the process and thus a train test split the final step of knowledge from data is
computers is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set not all patterns
computers patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid it is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns
computers patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set this is called overfitting to overcome this
computers this the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained the learned patterns
computers patterns are applied to this test set and the resulting output is compared to the desired output for example a data
computers data mining algorithm trying to distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on a training set of sample e mails
computers mails once trained the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e mails on which it had not
computers not been trained the accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e mails they correctly classify a
computers a number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm such as roc curves if the learned patterns do
computers do not meet the desired standards subsequently it is necessary to re evaluate and change the pre processing and data mining
computers mining steps if the learned patterns do meet the desired standards then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns

computers from sensor data or databases a major focus of machine learning research is to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and
computers and make intelligent decisions based on data hence machine learning is closely related to fields such as statistics probability theory data

computers inductive bias based on previous experience the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical
computers theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually
computers usually does not yield absolute guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common in
computers in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a
computers a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results
computers results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain
computers certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time there are a lot of similarities between machine learning theory and statistics although
computers although they use different terms machine learning refers to a system capable of the autonomous acquisition and integration of knowledge this
computers this capacity to learn from experience analytical observation and other means results in a system that can continuously self improve and
computers and thereby offer increased efficiency and effectiveness machine learning is the subfield of ai that studies the automated acquisition of domain
computers domain specific knowledge the goal of these systems is to improve their performance as the result of experience studies in this
computers this field include problem classification and decomposition principals of intelligence reasoning and natural language processing machine learning can be looked at

computers based approaches to learning the discipline and future of machine learning video of tom mitchell s march seminar talk at the
computers the carnegie mellon university school of computer science s machine learning department over the past years the study of machine learning
computers learning has grown from the efforts of a handful of computer engineers exploring whether computers could learn to play games and
computers and a field of statistics that largely ignored computational considerations to a broad discipline that has produced fundamental statistical computational theories
computers theories of learning processes has designed learning algorithms that are routinely used in commercial systems from speech recognition to computer vision
computers vision and has spun off an industry in data mining to discover hidden regularities in the growing volume of online data
computers data this talk will provide a personal view of the current state of machine learning and where i think the field
computers field might should be headed over the coming decade i ll propose several specific research areas which seem to me to
computers to have great potential and will leave plenty of time at the end for audience discussion what is machine learning machine
computers machine learning usually refers to the changes in systems that perform tasks associated with artificial intelligence ai such tasks involve recognition
computers recognition diagnosis planning robot control prediction etc to be slightly more specific we show the architecture of a typical ai agent
computers agent in fig one might ask why should machines have to learn why not design machines to perform as desired in
computers in the first place there are several reasons why machine learning is important software that learns by doing machine learning techniques
computers techniques have been used to create self improving software for decades but recent advances are bringing these tools into the mainstream
computers mainstream by gary h anthes computerworld february attempts to create self improving software date to the s but machine learning as
computers as it s often called has remained mostly the province of academic researchers with only a few niche applications in the
computers the commercial world such as speech recognition and credit card fraud detection now researchers say better algorithms more powerful computers and
computers and a few clever tricks will move it further into the mainstream computer scientist tom mitchell director of the center for
computers for automated learning and discovery at carnegie mellon university says machine learning is useful for the kinds of tasks that humans
computers humans do easily speech and image recognition for example but that they have trouble explaining explicitly in software rules in machine
computers machine learning applications software is trained on test cases devised and labeled by humans scored so it knows what it got
computers got right and wrong and then sent out to solve real world cases mitchell is testing the concept of having two
computers two classes of learning algorithms in essence train each other machine learns games like a human by will knight new scientist

computers is situated by modifying the relationships between individual neurons rather than representing knowledge in explicit logical sentences they capture it implicitly
computers implicitly as a property of patterns of relationships george f luger the human brain the human brain is an incredibly impressive
computers impressive information processor even though it works quite a bit slower than an ordinary computer many researchers in artificial intelligence look
computers look to the organization of the brain as a model for building intelligent machines think of a sort of analogy between
computers between the complex webs of interconnected neurons in a brain and the densely interconnected units making up an artificial neural network
computers network ann where each unit just like a biological neuron is capable of taking in a number of inputs and producing
computers producing an output consider this description to develop a feel for this analogy let us consider a few facts from neurobiology
computers neurobiology the human brain is d to contain a densely interconnected network of approximately neurons each connected on average to others
computers others neuron activity is typically excited or inhibited through connections to other neurons the fastest neuron switching times are known to
computers to be on the order of seconds quite slow compared to computer switching speeds of seconds yet humans are able to
computers to make surprisingly complex decisions surprisingly quickly for example it requires approximately seconds to visually recognize your mother notice the sequence
computers sequence of neuron firings that can take place during this second interval cannot possibly be longer than a few hundred steps
computers steps giving the switching speed of single neurons this observation has led many to speculate that the information processing abilities of
computers of biological neural systems must from highly parallel processes operating on representations that are distributed over many neurons one motivation for
computers for ann systems is to capture this kind of highly parallel computation based on distributed representations from machine learning section page

computers am see http enginepuller com matt marshall am re other languages good point powerset said it mindful of this but like
computers like so much of its operations its exact progress here is secretive so we just don t know it s certainly
computers certainly a major challenge nathaniel am it seems like you are putting a huge value on natural search and presuming that
computers that it is the holy grail although there is huge potential it seems presumptuous to assume that users will prefer it
computers it over current solutions and even more presumptuous to assume that the technology from parc is the best of breed in
computers in the space it is especially hard to appreciate the value without seeing anything as pointed out by an earlier poster
computers poster and as mentioned by norvig there are numerous ways to approach natural search indicating that having the parc technology licensed
computers licensed out from under google s nose didn t have them losing sleep at night once the technology is released to
computers to the public and there are meaningful results i will be the first in line to try it out and listen
computers listen to customer reactions but it seems a bit premature to knock a few points off of google s stock price
computers price john ebbert am interesting info and a competitor to google in search is good no doubt i am not convinced
computers convinced until i see the product though thomas hawk am if their technology really works which is a big if of
computers of course remember when riya claimed to do facial recognition now they sell shoes then i d think that yahoo microsoft
computers microsoft or ica should be even more interested in acquiring the company than google rob hyndman am typo gt imb blake
computers blake carrington am google has a huge natural language team as does yahoo but the challenge they have is a user
computers user base trained on using two and three word search strings even if they added awesome nl no one would use
computers use it that said as great as google s results are now i have no doubt that in a few years
computers years people will look back and think about how primitive the page rank idea is matt marshall am thanks on typo
computers typo fixed steve morsa am as promising as their natural language platform sounds and it does the greatest threat to google
computers google s growing hegemony in the search paid search arenas given that about of all searches are known to be for
computers for products and services may actually spring from patent pending paid match which will target people s actual demographic and psychographic
computers psychographic traits and characteristics keytraits instead of just the words we all type into little search boxes though like powerset s
computers s paid match is not yet an operating system our own us dept of labor does run a very popular service
computers service over users which provides an enlightening and instructive peak at the potential that such a paid match search ad platform
computers platform possesses called govbenefits available at govbenefits gov it utilizes a personal profile and a match engine to determine what government
computers government benefit programs people qualify for were such a system populated with the s of thousands to millions of products and
computers and services companies provide nation worldwide instead of just the odd government programs it includes now one can only imagine what
computers what its public popularity would be and with the world s advertisers having the ability to pinpoint target and control via
computers via bidding directly on those keytraits most relevant and applicable to their products and services exactly who sees their ads goodbye
computers goodbye click fraud one can also only imagine the deleterious effects that such an elegant and superior system platform would have
computers have on a ppc income dependent company like google ronald am who acquired ibm i didn t know ibm was acquired
computers acquired or what s the difference between my company acquiring a computer from ibm and and somebody else acquiring a business
computers business unit now if i make up an article about my company acquiring ibm will this article turn up as a
computers a result page ranking would maybe list it as the m link since nobody will believe it and link to it
computers it in other words nlp without shared context is just random sentences used in a conversation or you have a lot
computers lot of explaining to do about what you mean and what you trust or for a right wing nut liberal has
computers has a totally different meaning then for a left wing nut so while page rank includes some of the wisdom of
computers of the crowd how does nlp do that language is very subjective in other words your client system has share your
computers your context with the server if you want to stay sane and get some things done but we are are a
computers a few years away from pretty pictures in the ui to context driven machines but less then years if somebody would
computers would ask me nobody does by the way don t know why sean wilson am interesting article nl will be a
computers a useful tool but as the amount of data available on the web grows faster over time i think it will
computers will be even more useful in limited contexts instead of for broad based search engine applicatons personally i d like to
computers to see a market for elite managed directories that those listed pay to participate in with an account manager handling a
computers a couple hundred sites all of which are highly relevant and vetted for a particular niche a hundred such niches in
computers in a directory that a business or journalist could subscribe to and get quality content answers and results that would serve
computers serve not only as quality research but even immediately actionable intelligence would be kind of cool combine that with yahoo pipes
computers pipes and you could make for a powerful model the problem isn t with search technology so much as it is
computers is with content quality while it might sound a bit retro i wouldn t mind seeing a return of edited directories
computers directories combined with the new nl technology i d pay a subscription fee for vetted results and depend on piped data
computers data that met very specific requirements for outside information and news from xml feeds some day when google bombs are gone
computers gone i might buy into the notion that search is anything to lose sleep over word of mouth and social networking
computers networking are still more intriguing than search to me perhaps because i still put more creedence in wom than any other
computers other marketing tool pipes might help change the status quo for mining data effectively from rss feeds so might this nl
computers nl effort by powerset do the same for search i won t hold my breath hoping anyway great post tbee pm
computers pm don t autonomy the british software company have natural language search they claim to have meaning based computing consumers largely

computers there going to be some patent infringement issues here tim pm search engine technology it says may help propel it past
computers past google propel it past google in what way in that they deliver better results in that they ll have more
computers more users in that they ll make more money i could say that msn has better search relevancy than google but
computers but does that mean everyone s going to switch tomorrow google is a powerhouse because of their advertising their search relevancy
computers relevancy is just good enough what sort of money printing machine is powerset building there s no mention of it ronald
computers ronald s point about shared context is extremely relevant i would say google s answer to this is personalized search it
computers it s just in its infancy but it s a start i would say at least or probably more important in
computers in maintaining users is establishing that relationship how long will it take to establish a relationship with powerset so it understands

computers my all time favorite search story is about when i was researching a programming problem i had typed in a line
computers line of compiler generated assembly language that had generated an error the first page returned by the search contained the answer
computers answer i was looking for of course being taken to the exact page was the result of entering a very specific
computers specific query i had entered a fairly long list of query terms each of which have pretty low frequency in the
computers the total web content and of course i was lucky that that page did in fact exist to me the value
computers value in search is finding the one single page that has the exact detail you are looking for in my example
computers example above this occurred because of the number of explicit search terms i had entered but most often i have to
computers to manually search through many pages until either i find what i am looking for eventually search capabilities will improve to
computers to give users more targeted search results by targeted i mean a better threshold for what is relevant to the query
computers query than just this page contains the words you asked for eventually the search threshold will be this page contains the
computers the meaning you asked for in time linguistics will be applied to help improve search capabilities things like word sense disambiguation
computers disambiguation word synonyms and sentence structure will likely all play in this caribbean guy am there are three major problems with
computers with this approach first it is technically difficult to do it well second it isn t necessarily going to be more
computers more appealing to users because they need to use more keystrokes third it tends to create a higher expectation level for
computers for users so users will tend to be more critical of the results any failure to correctly interpret and answer their
computers their question tends to be very noticeable in contrast the simplistic keyword approach less typing it is easier for the search
computers search engine to accomplish and because of the crude manner in which the words are typed into the box users tend
computers tend to dismiss failures as an indication that they failed to type the right keywords vivek juneja am hi i believe
computers believe in what the above person says that has been the major bottleneck when developing any nlu engine i myself had

computers natural language processing blog my biased thoughts on the fields of natural language processing nlp computational linguistics cl and related topics
computers topics machine learning math funding etc february language and x i feel it is increasingly interesting to look at problems that
computers that have both a linguistic and a non linguistic signal the simplest example i can think of here is recent work
computers work in looking at images and their captions eg the matching words and pictures approach though this is not the only
computers only such example the idea in many of these techniques is that we have a single data set that contains two
computers two types of data one is language eg the captions and the other is something else eg the images there are
computers are many other potentially interesting sources of data like this that i ll discuss after saying why i think these problems
computers problems are interesting i think there are two basic reasons why such dual problems are interesting by looking at multiple modalities
computers modalities we can get cross modality reinforcement of what we re learning i think a great example of that is this
computers this paper which uses face recognition together with textual coreference in order to do unsupervised coref in captions the idea is
computers is that if you can tell that two different pictures contain the entity we call bill clinton in them then it
computers it s more likely that a name in their caption will corefer this gives us a greater ability to share data
computers data across a single data set when language is treated in the context of some other source of information we get
computers get a sort of grounding effect that is continuing the coref example from we have in some sense grounded the string
computers string bill clinton to a pictorial representation of a person sure this representation is still just a bunch of symbols but
computers but they re markedly different symbols from the ones we use to represent the entity in purely linguistic terms perhaps hard
computers hard core cognitive scientists wouldn t call this grounding but it s getting there also along these lines one of my
computers my favorite papers from a few years ago was my ex isi friend mike doing grounding by looking and language and
computers and action in video games there are probably other reasons why such tasks are interesting but these are the two that
computers that appeal to me most strongly it seems that vision language is the hot topic or at least the warmest of
computers of the bunch this is probably because vision people and language people tend to overlap and meet at machine learning conferences
computers conferences it s probably also because the sorts of techniques used by the two communities are perhaps the most similar but
computers but i think there s lots of room for looking at other x s for instance biology there are lots of
computers of data sets eg geo that contain textual information these are cell lines depicting ovarian cancer plus the actual cell lines
computers lines heck many papers in pubmed contain such information albeit in figures rather than matrices robotics is another option ray mooney
computers mooney s group down in texas has worked at understanding orders given to robocup competitors based on language information eg this
computers this paper perhaps the oldest that actually lives within the nlp community is nlp databases which we really haven t seen
computers seen much of in the past years i don t think we understand structured prediction i ve posted on structured prediction
computers prediction a few times before and then some this is another post but with a different perspective besides the most recent
computers recent time was last may so it s been a while this post is prompted by a recent oped by john
computers john lafferty and larry wasserman on challenges in machine learning in statistica sinica where they mention sp as one of three
computers three major open questions in machine learning the other two are semi sup and sparse learning in high dimensions i ve
computers ve been trying to think of a good way of ontologizing sp methods recently primarily because i want to understand them
computers them better the more i think about it the more i feel like we really don t understand the important issues
computers issues this is partially evidenced by an observation that in the past six years essentially since the first crf paper there
computers there have been like different algorithms proposed for this problem the fact that there are so many proposed algorithms tells me
computers me that we don t really understand what s going on otherwise we wouldn t need to keep coming up with
computers with new techniques i m not innocent to me the strongest division between techniques is between techniques that require tractable inference
computers inference in the underlying problem eg crfs m ns svm struct structured perceptron mira memms hmms etc and those that don
computers don t eg incremental perceptron laso searn the liang lacoste julien klein taskar mt algorithm local predictors ala roth and colleagues
computers colleagues etc whether this truly is the most important distinction is unclear but to me it is i think of the
computers the former set as a sort of top down or technology push techniques while the latter are a sort of bottom
computers bottom up or application pull techniques both are entirely reasonable and good ways of going at looking at the problem but
computers but as of now the connections between the two types are only weakly understood an alternative division is between generative techniques
computers techniques hmms conditional methods crfs and margin based techniques everything else minus searn which is sort of non committal with respect
computers respect to this issue i don t really think this is an important distinction because with the exception of generative being
computers being quite different conditional methods and margin based methods are essentially the same in my mind yes i understand there are
computers are important differences but it seems that in the grand scheme of things this is not such a relevant distinctions a
computers a related issue is whether the algorithms admit a kernelized version pretty much all do and even if not i also
computers also don t see this as a very important issue there are other issues some of which are mentioned in the
computers the lafferty wasserman paper one is consistency for those unfamiliar with the term a consistent algorithm is essentially one that is
computers is guaranteed to find the optimal solution if given infinite amounts of data crfs are consistent m ns are not searn
computers searn is not even if you use a consistent classifier as the base learning algorithm my sense is that to statisticians
computers statisticians things like consistency matter a lot in practice my opinion is that they re less important because we never have
computers have that much data even within the context of techniques that don t require tractability there is a great deal of
computers of variation to my knowledge this family of techniques was essentially spawned by collins and roark with the incremental perceptron my
computers my laso thing was basically just a minor tweak on the ip searn is rather different but other published methods are
computers are largely other minor variants on the ip and or laso depending on where you measure from and i truly mean
computers mean minor tweaks the essentially difference between laso and ip is whether you restart your search at the truth when you
computers you err doing restarts tends to help and it lets you prove a theorem we later had a nips workshop paper
computers paper that restarted but allowed the algorithm to take a few steps off the right path before doing so this helped
computers helped experimentally and also admitted another theorem i ve seen other work that does essentially the same thing but tweaks how
computers how updates are done exactly and or how restarts happen the fact that we re essentially trying all permutations tells me
computers me that many things are reasonable and we re currently in the gather data part of trying to figure out the
computers the best way to do things bag of words citation i was recently asked by a colleague if i knew what
computers what the first paper was that used the bag of words model i m pretty certain it would be an ir
computers ir paper but have no idea what i would be manning schutze and jurafsky martin don t have it i know
computers know tf idf is due to sparck jones but i presumably bow existed before that the vector space model is often
computers often credited to salton which is probably the earliest thing i know of but my guess is that bow predated even
computers even that errors happen and sometimes get in to papers a recent example is the jair paper i had with daniel
computers daniel on domain adaptation last year i actually didn t catch the error myself it was caught by someone who was
computers was reimplementing the technique and it s a totally not insignificant error essentially the update equation for the generative parameters is
computers is completely botched if you look through the derivation in the appendix it s clear where the error crept in thankfully
computers thankfully this sort of error is essentially a typo that is the error was introduced when i was typing up the
computers the paper not when i was doing the research why this is important is that it means the the implementation reflects
computers reflects the correct updates only the paper has the mistake this means that the experimental results from the paper are valid
computers valid contingent on the fact that you rederive the updates yourself or just ask me what they should be i m
computers m writing this post because it s somewhat unclear what to do when such a thing arises one temptation is to
computers to do nothing i have to admit that i was completely embarrassed when this was pointed out to me there was
computers was a part of me that wanted to ignore it it seems that this is the wrong approach for a variety
computers variety of reasons not the least of which is to make sure that correct information does get out the question to
computers to some degree is exactly how to do this i have a blog which means i can write an entry like
computers like this i can also put an errata on my web page that points out the errors i m writing this
computers this up as we speak given that this is a pub in an online journal i believe i am able to
computers to submit updates or at least additional appendices which means that the official version can probably be remedied but what about
computers about conference pubs if this had appeared in acl and i didn t have a blog the situation would be something
computers something different ironically an earlier version with the correct updates had been rejected from acl because the derivations were omitted for
computers for space and two reviewers couldn t verify them also what if someone hadn t pointed it out to me i
computers i certainly wouldn t have noticed that paper was behind me but then anyone who noticed the errors might dismiss the
computers the results on the grounds that they could assume that the implementation was also incorrect it s not inconceivable that an
computers an erroneous implementation can still get good results this would also not be good because the idea in the paper any
computers any paper with such errors might actually be interesting false things are published all the time the stoc focs community i
computers i e theory community has a handful of examples for them errors are easy to identify because you can prove the
computers the opposite of any theorem i recall hearing of a sequence of several papers that incrementally used results from a previous
computers previous but the first was in error putting the rest in error i also recall hearing that many of the subsequent
computers subsequent results could be salvaged despite the ancestral mistake i don t know if there s a good solution given our
computers our publication mechanisms essentially publish once then appear in the anthology but i m pretty sure mine is not the first
computers first paper with such errors at least i hope not acl again this year in the machine learning subcomponent a couple
computers couple of days ago i received my notice to start bidding on papers more on bidding below the email came with
computers with the ing note naturally reviewers have been chosen to assess papers based on their own expertise and outlook having said
computers said this we are aware that acl has sometimes been perceived especially in recent years as overemphasizing the pursuit of small
computers small incremental improvements of existing methods perhaps at the expense of exciting new developments acl is solid but boring is what
computers what some people would say while we believe that it would be counterproductive to change course radically we certainly would not
computers not want to sacrifice solidity we would like to encourage you as a reviewer to look out particularly for what s
computers s novel and interesting even if this means accepting a paper that has one or two flaws for example because it
computers it has not been evaluated as rigourously as you would like it is for you to judge when a flaw becomes
computers becomes a genuine problem i think this is fantastic would someone who is reviewing i e on the pc for another
computers another area confirm or deny that all areas got such a message or was it just ml one difficulty i always
computers always have as a reviewer is that i assign scores to different categories originality interest citations etc and then am asked
computers asked to come up with a meta score that summarizes all these scores but i m not given any instruction on
computers on how to weigh the different components what this note seems to be doing is saying weigh interest higher than you
computers you usually would in the past two years or so i ve been trying to do this i think that when
computers when you start out reviewing it s tempting to pick apart little details on a paper rather than focusing on the
computers the big picture it s been a conscious and sometimes difficult process for me to get over this this explicit note
computers note is nice to see because it is essentially saying that my own internal process is a good one or at
computers at least whomever wrote it thinks it s a good one i also think in comparison to other conferences i ve
computers ve pced for or reviewed for that acl does a really good job of moderating the bidding process for those unfamiliar
computers unfamiliar with bidding when a paper gets submitted some area chair picks it up all papers under an area chair are
computers are shown title plus abstract to the reviewers in that area reviewers can bid i want to review this i don
computers don t want to review this i am qualified to review this or conflict of interest there is then some optimization
computers optimization strategy to satisfy reviewers preferences constraints in comparison to ecml and nips in the past the acl strategy of dividing
computers dividing into area chairs seems to be a good thing for ecml i got a list of about papers to select
computers select from and i had to rank them or i don t remember this was a huge hassle it seems that
computers that of most of the conferences that i m familiar with acl has a pretty decent policy while i would be
computers be thrilled to see them introduce an author feedback step everything else seems to work pretty well in the past i
computers i ve only once gotten in to a real argument over a paper with other reviewers most of the time all
computers all the reviewer scores have tended to be or out of ten of each other error analysis to be performed and
computers and reported in papers while this is perhaps a bit extreme more on this later there are at least two reasons
computers reasons why this would be desirable when multiple techniques exist for solving the same problem and they get reasonably close scores
computers scores is this because they are making the same sort of errors or different sorts if someone were to build on
computers on your paper and try to improve it where should they look there s an additional aspect that comes up especially
computers especially once you re in a sort of supervisory role it s often hard to get students to actually look at
computers at outputs and forcing this as part of the game early on is a good idea i was the same as
computers as a student and continue to be the same now only two or three our of a dozen or so papers
computers papers of mine contain an error analysis this situation reminds me a bit of an excellent talk i saw a few
computers few years ago at acl or emnlp in barcelona i think by mitch marcus talking about some parsing stuff i don
computers don t really remember much of his talk except that he kept flashing a single slide that read look at the
computers the data stupid his argument was essentially that we re not going to be able to model what we want to
computers to model unless we really understand what s going on in the data representing the phenomena we re trying to study
computers study an exercise that s also good from this perspective is to do some data annotation yourself this is perhaps even
computers even more painful than doing an error analysis but it really drives home the difficulties in the task getting back to
computers to the point at hand i don t think it s feasible or even necessarily advisable to require all papers to
computers to include an error analysis but i also think that more papers should contain error analyses than actually do including some
computers some of my own in the universal struggle to fit papers within an page limit things have to get cut it
computers it seems that the error analysis is the first thing to get cut in that it gets cut before the paper
computers paper is even typically by not being performed but at least for me when i read a paper i want to
computers to know after the fact what i have learned occasionally it s a new learning technique or occasionally it s some
computers some new useful features or sometimes it s a new problem but if you were to take the most popular problems
computers problems out there that i don t work on mt parsing language modeling asr etc i really have no idea what
computers what problems are still out there i can guess i think names in mt are hard as is ordering i think
computers think probably attachment and conjunctions in parsing i have little idea in lm and asr computational linguistics from parc i hope
computers hope that everyone can access this freely but i sadly suspect it is not so i m half tempted to reproduce
computers reproduce it since i think it s really worth reading but i don t want to piss off the gods at
computers at mit press too much the main point i got from the article is that we really need to pay attention
computers attention to how annotation is done a lot of our exuberance for annotating is due to the success of machine learning
computers learning approaches on the treebank so we have since gone out and annotated probably hundreds of corpora for dozens of other
computers other tasks the article focuses on coreference but i think most of the claims apply broadly the first point made is
computers is that the treebank annotation was controlled and done by experts linguists many other annotates are not done so are done
computers done without real standards and without deep analysis of the task the immediate problem then is that a learning algorithm that
computers that succeeds on the annotated data is not necessarily solving the right task there was a similar story that my ex
computers ex office mate alex fraser ran across in machine translation specifically with evaluating alignments for machine translation the basic problem was
computers was two fold first the dataset that everyone used the french english data from aachen was essentially broken due largely to
computers to its distinction between sure and possible links almost every word pair was possibly linked this together with the broken evaluation
computers evaluation metric alignment error rate or aer made results on this dataset virtually useless the conclusion is essentially don t use
computers use the aachen data and don t use aer that is don t use them if you want improved mt performance
computers performance i e if you expect higher alignment performance to imply higher mt performance if this sounds familiar it s perhaps
computers perhaps because i mentioned it before i should say i largely agree with the article where i differ perhaps only by
computers by epsilon is that the article seems to pick on annotation for machine learning but i really don t see any
computers any reason why the fact that we re using machine learning matters the issue is really one of evaluation we need
computers need to know that at the end of the day when we compute a number that number matters we can compute
computers compute a number intrinsically or extrinsically in the extrinsic case we are golden assuming the extrinsic task is real turtles upon
computers upon turtles in the intrinsic case the situation is fishy we have to make sure that both our annotations mean something
computers something and our method of computing error rate means something ala the error metric types and the use of f for
computers for named entities while i ve argued on this blog that the error metric is important the cl article argues that
computers that the annotation is important i think that as someone who is on the machine learning side this is easy to
computers to forget survey of parser usage i know people use parsers a fair amount i m curious which parsers people use
computers use thus a new poll what i m interested in in particular is if you use a parser essentially as a
computers a preprocessing step before doing something higher level in other words if you are mark johnson and you use the charniak
computers charniak parser to build a better parser this doesn t count sorry mark i want to know if you use one
computers one to do eg summarization or mt or ie or something other than parser also i don t count shallow parsing
computers parsing in this context i look forward to responses do you use a parser for your work nope no parsing in
computers in this neck of the woods yes one of the brown parsers charniak johnson etc yes one of the collins parsers
computers parsers collins bikel etc yes minipar yes one of the conll dependency parsers nivre mcdonald etc yes a rule based parser
computers parser this database was pretty huge many thousands of problems neatly categorized and searchable for emails for which the answer existed
computers existed in the database it took maybe seconds to send the reply out what seems to be happening nowadays is that
computers that this is being taken to the extreme a pre form letter is always used regardless of whether it is appropriate
computers appropriate or not if it is a person doing this bad routing that s a waste of seconds of person time
computers time probably more for these large companies if it s a machine it s no big deal from there perspective but
computers but it makes me immediately hate the company with my whole heart but this seems to be a really interesting text
computers text categorization routing problem basically you have lots of normal classes the pre letters plus a needs human attention class there
computers there s a natural precision recall trade off which is somewhat different and more complex than is standardly considered but it
computers it s clearly an nlp text categorization problem and clearly one that should be worked on i know from my friends
computers friends at at t that they have something similar for routing calls but my understanding is that this is quite different
computers different their routing happens based on short bits of information into a small number of categories the customer service routing problem
computers problem would presumably be based on lots of information in a large number of categories you could argue that this is
computers is no different from providing a help search option on the ebay web page but i think it s different if
computers if for no other reason that how it appears to the user if the user thinks he is writing an email
computers email to a person he will write a good email with full sentences and lots of information naacl accepted papers see
computers see here i probably won t be going to naacl so if afterwards someone wants to volunteer to post a few
computers few papers they especially liked i d appreciate it learning when test and train inputs have different distributions nips workshop i
computers i spent the second day of workshops at nips while not skiing attending the learning when test and train inputs have
computers have different distributions workshop this is closely related or really just a different name for the domain adaptation problem i ve
computers ve been interested in for quite some time unfortunately i can t easily come across the list of papers there were
computers were some good ones which means that my memory may be lacking at some parts here are some points i took
computers took away statisticians have worked on this problem for a long time if you provide insurance you re going to want
computers want a predictor to say whether to give a new person a policy or not you have lots of data on
computers on people and whether they made any claims unfortunately the training data people you have information on is limited to those
computers those to whom you gave policies so the test distribution entire popular differs from the training distribution people to whom you
computers you gave policies some guy can t remember his name right now actually won a nobel prize in economics for a
computers a partial solution to this problem which was termed covariate shift because statisticians call our inputs covariates and they are changing
computers changing there seems to be a strong desire to specify models which though see the comment below can be characterized as
computers as train p y x and test p y x are the same but train p x and test p x
computers x differ in other words the labeling function is the same but the distribution over inputs is different this is probably
computers probably the clearest way to differentiate domain adaptation from multitask learning for the latter we typically assume p x stays the
computers the same but p y x changes i m not sure that this is really a hugely important distinction it may
computers may be to obtain interesting theoretical results but my sense is that in the problems i encounter both p x and
computers and p y x are changing but hopefully not by too much an interesting point made along these lines by shai
computers shai ben david that i spent a bunch of time thinking about several years ago was that from a theoretical perspective
computers perspective assuming p y x is the same is a vacuous assumption because you can always take two radically different p
computers p x and q x add a feature that indicates which p vs q the data point came from and call
computers call this the global p x in fact in some sense this is all you need to do to solve multitask
computers multitask learning or domain adaptation just add a feature saying which distribution the input is from and learn a single model
computers model i ve been doing some experiments recently and while you can do better than this in practice with standard learning
computers learning models it s not such a bad approach there were several other talks i liked it seemed that the results
computers results theoretically were of the form if p y x is the same and p x and p y differ only
computers only by a little then doing naive things for learning can do nicely my favorite formalization of p x and p
computers p y differ a little was the shai ben david john blitzer approach of saying that they differ slightly if there
computers there is a single hyperplane that does well has low error on both problems the restriction to hyperplanes is convenient for
computers for what they do later but in general it seems that having a single hypothesis from some class that will do
computers do well on both problems is the general sense of what p y x is the same is really supposed to
computers to mean i also enjoyed a talk by alex smola on essentially learning the differences between the input distributions and using
computers using this to your advantage in general my sense was that people are really starting to understand this problem theoretically but
computers but i really didn t see any practical results that convinced me at all most practical results modulo the ben david
computers david blitzer which essentially cites john s old work were very nipsish in the sense that they were on unrealistic datasets
computers datasets sorry but it s true i wholeheartedly acknowledge that its somewhat difficult to get your hands on good data for
computers for this problem but there is data out there and it s plentiful enough that it should no longer be necessary
computers necessary to make artificial or semi artificial data for this problem after all if there weren t real data out there
computers there we wouldn t be working on this problem or at least we shouldn t p back from nips the s
computers s are upon us hence the lack of posts but i wanted to give a brief nod to nips which i
computers i thought went pretty well this year the highlights for me note that i didn t attend everything so the usual
computers usual qualifications apply were the netflex prize talk bennett talked about the origins of the prize and how well people are
computers are doing they seem to firmly believe that the goal will be met there s some indication it actually won t
computers t take all that long currently leading the pack at the time of the talk was wxyz who is one of
computers of my old cmu buddies yi zhang now at ucsc nearly tied for first was geoff hinton s group up at
computers at toronto there weren t any details given about what people are doing to do so well but it seems reasonable
computers reasonable to assume that toronto is doing something with deep belief nets more later free lunches invited talk by dan ariely
computers ariely this was probably my favorite talk of the whole conference the gist of the talk is that it s really
computers really easy to get humans to behave in ways that defy the standard cost benefit analysis setting a few fun examples
computers examples split a bunch of people into two groups have one group write down things they like about their significant other
computers other have the other group write things then ask them how much they love their so the result is that the
computers the things group loves them much more presumably because no one can actually list things there were also a lot of
computers of examples about how often people cheat the basic result is that it seems that knowing you cannot be caught does
computers does not necessarily make you cheat more also if you prime people by having them sign an honor code they cheat
computers cheat less there were many more examples i m not quite positive what the take home message was but it was
computers was a very interesting talk analysis of representations for domain adaptation blitzer et al this is the first compelling analysis i
computers i ve seen of the domain adaptation problem the basic idea is to bound generalization error based on the distance between
computers between the source and target distributions quite clever and john says that they may even try to develop algorithms that explicitly
computers explicitly minimize this bound boosting structured prediction for imitation learning ratliff et al a cute feature boosting algorithm for sp problems
computers problems used for the ing a map problem large margin gaussian mms for asr sha saul do standard gaussian mixture modeling
computers modeling for asr but put a large margin constraint on the gaussians do a hard em like thing to get fixed
computers fixed cluster assignments and you can write this as a semi definite program very cute greedy layer wise training of deep
computers deep networks bengio et al deep belief nets can do a really good job at some vision problems but they re
computers re quite hard to train symmetries etc the basic idea here is to initialize the training by a simple layer at
computers at a time method the thing i found especially interesting is that their initialization looks a lot like a predict yourself
computers yourself sort of strategy which seems to be a recurring theme in a lot of unsupervised semi supervised learning problem there
computers there were also a lot of good workshops i most enjoyed the one on covariate shift i e domain adaptation i
computers i enjoyed it so much i plan to post separately on it in a few days schedule permitting i gave a
computers a talk today at our small group meeting about feature engineering for coreference resolution problems i think it is oft underappreciated
computers underappreciated by people myself occasionally included who spend a lot of time working on fancy machine learning algorithms that the difference
computers difference between success and failure often hinges more on clever features than on fancy learning for those who want to look
computers look at the slides you can take an openoffice or pdf version for your perusal i forewarn that it may be
computers be a bit hard to without the soundtrack but it s sort of an untold story version of the coref paper
computers paper we had at hlt emnlp so what did we do that s clever or at least as far clever as
computers as i knew at the time and know now well a few things first i tried extending the notion of hobbs
computers hobbs distance to discourse trees this actually works surprisingly well the true referent is the first element according to syntactic hobbs
computers hobbs distance in about of the cases and we almost see the same thing at the discourse level the only oddity
computers oddity is that you have to flip the nuclearity of the attribution relation then you get about holding assuming perfect discourse
computers discourse trees of course we never have perfect discourse trees and the noise introduced by poor parsing is enough to make
computers make this feature more or less useless the second thing we tried was to use this name instance data that mike
computers mike fleischman gathered at isi before going off to mit this data was gathered in the context of q a to
computers to answer questions like who is the president of the u s by using lookup tables but it s great data
computers data for coref it includes about million examples of names paired with their occupations maybe you can find this data interesting
computers interesting too mike describes it more in his acl paper these guys make a huge difference in coref performance the next
computers next thing that helped a lot was a clever non standard use of gazetteers what we do is take the id
computers id of the gazetteer to which the anaphor belongs and pair it with the lexical item of the antecedent why well
computers well suppose we have a gazetteer that contains words like california and utah and new york by pairing this list id
computers id eg list with antecedents we get features like list and state or list and country etc we ll probably learn
computers learn that the former is a good feature and the latter is not we also have a feature that checks to
computers to see if the two referents are on the same gazetteer but are not the same word why this is a
computers a negative feature california and utah appear on the same list states but are not identical string wise so they re
computers re probably not coreferent we tried pretty hard to get wordnet to work but it just kept not helping wordnet distance
computers distance is a terrible measure eg japan and russia have distance they are both under country on the other hand like
computers like in the gazetteer case nearby in wordnet but not the same word is a reasonably good feature though it turned
computers turned out not to help much hypernym and hyponym were the most promising but we never actually got any benefit from
computers from them the rest of the stuff in the talk made it fairly close to the front of the paper the
computers the most surprising result was that count based features help a lot these features look at things like the entity to
computers to mention ratio the number of entities detected so far etc these can t be included in a simple coref model
computers model that makes pairwise decisions but for us it s easy the end result is that using just string based features
computers features standard substring and edit distance stuff lexical features word pairs count based features and mike s data we can get
computers get an ace score of using laso for doing the learning this goes up about if you use searn in most
computers most cases but i don t have all the numbers adding in some inference to predict things like number and gender
computers gender gets you up to gazetteers get you up to after that the rest of the features regular expression patterns word
computers word clusters wordnet discourse and syntax don t help all together they get you up to but that s not much
computers much bang for the buck my conclusion is basically that while learning makes a difference searn is a bit better than
computers than laso the feature engineering makes a bigger one many of the features we found useful were a priori not really
computers really that obvious i spent a or two of my life trying to come up with ways of being clever to
computers to help improve performance playing on dev data so as to be fair it s definitely a non trivial enterprise but
computers but it often pays off this is assuming that your learning is robust enough to handle the features you want for
computers for instance the standard pairwise models could not handle the count based features that helped us a lot any stem cell
computers cell research i was listening to npr a few weeks ago while pre election news was still accosting my ears though
computers though not in my state shockingly there was apparently a measure on the ballots in a lot of states referencing stem
computers stem cell research the title of the measure was apparently should any stem cell research be allowed okay quick quiz how
computers how did you first interpret that sentence if you were in favor of certain varieties but not all varieties of stem
computers stem cell research would you vote for it in other words does any mean at least one type of or all
computers all types of to me and at least a few other people i ve talked to the prefered interpretation is all
computers all it s also much easier to reach this interpretation if you put a bit of stress on any but it
computers it s also really easy to get the other interpretation by unstressing any or by putting another sentence in front of
computers of it eg stem cell research in all forms is purely evil p the strange thing is that i m really
computers really having a hard time coming up with other examples where the preference for all is so strong even with the
computers the stress it seems that the fact that stem cell research is a class of things rather than a single thing
computers thing is important it also seems that the presence of should is pretty much necessary but even so i really can
computers can t get anything else to come out with such a strong preference for all so what does this have to
computers to do with nlp well not too much other than language is hard something like this would probably kill a textual
computers textual entailment system but given that it s somewhat ambiguous even to people the degree of ambiguity is person relative though
computers though a brit here tells me that he has a really hard time getting the all interpretation at all maybe there
computers there s just nothing that can be done about it why speech summarization the vast majority of work on summarization is
computers is at the text level a document or collection of documents comes in as text and a summary goes out as
computers as text although i m certainly not one of the ones pushing summarization of speech i think it s quite an
computers an interesting task here by speech summarization i pretty much mean speech in speech out though similar arguments could be made
computers made for text in speech out applications a lot of my conclusion comes from personal experience but i also had a
computers a really great conversation with alan black who works on speech synthesis problems let me motivate this by an personal anecdote
computers anecdote my mom tends to leave really long voicemail messages like really long usually she overruns the alloted time and has
computers has to call back it s not uncommon for her messages to span three mailbox slots sorry mom if you re
computers re reading this the most interesting thing about these messages is that they really don t contain that much information in
computers in fact there s usually only one or two sentences in the whole thing that really matter at least from an
computers an information sense the problem is that you can t skim voicemail if i get an equally long email say one
computers one that would take me minutes to read i can fairly easily skim it to get the gist especially with some
computers some tailored highlighting i m able to absorb much more text per second than speech per second word on the street
computers street or at least around the croissant table at acl is that studies have been done that show that people can
computers can get at information from text just as fast if its presented in a summary as if its not summarized at
computers at all essentially because we re really good at skimming i knew high school english taught me something incidentally if anyone
computers anyone has a reference for this let me know i believe i saw it ages ago but i can t remember
computers remember where and i d love to have it so one solution to the mom s message problem is to run
computers run automatic speech recognition and turn it into an email this has the added advantage that i check my email much
computers much more frequently than i check my voicemail it gives me a record of the message after i ve deleted the
computers the speech signal to save space and allows for indexing but there are also times when i don t have easy
computers easy access to a computer and i really do want listen to the voicemail this is where speech summarization becomes interesting
computers interesting anyway if you re now convinced that speech summarization is interesting well i don t really know what to tell
computers tell you since i really haven t looked at this problem the work i am aware of and this is a
computers a very biased sample i apologize that i missed something is summarizing speech without text using hidden markov models by sameer
computers sameer maskey and julia hirshberg sentence extractive automatic speech summarization and evaluation techniques by makoto hirohata yosuke shinnaka koji iwano and
computers and sadaoki furui furui has been working in this area for a while i can t find this exact paper but
computers but his lab has others evaluation of sentence selection for speech summarization by xiaodan zhu and gerald penn additionally a quick
computers quick search turned up a recent workshop at interspeech on speech summarization which probably has more and information than i can
computers can easily produce myself sequence labeling okay at long last it s time for another edition of getting started in p
computers p s if you want to write one of these for your area of expertise i m very open to it
computers it so what is sequence labeling it s the meta problem that we face all the time in nlp tasks where
computers where we want to assign a single label to each element in a sequence for us a sequence is usually a
computers a sentence and a word is an element the elements we are trying to assign are usually things like parts of
computers of speech syntactic chunk labels is this part of a noun phrase verb phrase etc named entity labels is this a
computers a person and so on information extraction systems i e extracting meeting times and locations from emails can also be treated
computers treated as sequence labeling problems there are roughly two varieties of sequence labeling raw labeling and joint segmentation and labeling the
computers the latter is imo more common raw labeling is something like pos tagging where each element gets a single tag joint
computers joint segmentation and labeling is where whole segments get the same label for instance in named entity recognition a sentence like
computers like yesterday george bush gave a speech contains example one named entity george bush here we want to assign the label
computers label person to the entire phrase george bush not to individual words for instance if two named abut we need to
computers to know where they separate the easiest way to deal with segmentation problems is to transform them into raw labeling problems
computers problems the standard way to do this is the bio encoding where we label each word by b x i x
computers x or o here b x means begin a phrase of type x i x means continue a phrase of type
computers type x and o means not in a phrase for instance the bush sentence would be labeled as yesterday o o
computers o george b per bush i per gave o a o speech o o once can now treat this as a
computers a raw labeling problem perhaps being careful to avoid producing impossible sequences at test time eg an i x can only
computers only a b x or another i x other encodings are also possible so for now i ll concentrate on raw
computers raw labeling and revisit the true joint segmentation problem at the end in raw labeling we re faced with the problem
computers problem of assigning a single label to each word in a sequence perhaps the easiest approach is to predict each label
computers label independently then we just have a collection of multiclass classification tasks each label is a different class we can use
computers use whatever classifier we want for this despite it s simplicity this approach is actually quite effective for many problems intuitively
computers intuitively we usually believe that the labels in these problems are not independent for instance in pos tagging it s basically
computers basically impossible to have a verb immediately ing a determiner we would therefore like to use some local sequence information to
computers to improve our performance the old school approach to doing this is to use a hidden markov model hmm i ll
computers ll refer you to manning schutze for details here keeping in mind that really what we re using is just a
computers a markov model in these problems there is nothing that s hidden but the basic idea here is that we have
computers have two probability distributions a transition distribution how likely is it that a verb will a determiner and an emission distribution
computers distribution how likely is it that we ll see the word the given that we know this word should be a
computers a determiner if our transition probabilities are local then the viterbi algorithm will run efficiently at test time this locality is
computers is referred to as the markov assumption specifically a first order markov assumption says that the probability of label at time
computers time t is independent of label at time t given the label at time t the higher markov order you use
computers use the harder it is to decode complexity wise the potential problem with using hmms is that the emission probabilities are
computers are of the form p word tag where we d really like to model p tag word the latter is preferable
computers preferable because it s easier to include lots of overlapping features capitalization word identity prefixes suffixes stems etc the partial solution
computers solution is to use a maximum entropy markov model memm where we model p tag word using a maximum entropy model
computers model but keep everything else as in an hmm memms are only slightly more complex to train than hmms but work
computers work a whole lot better at training time we essentially include features having to do with the previous labels but otherwise
computers otherwise this is just as in the independent classifiers approach viterbi search still runs at test time so we re limited
computers limited to the same markov order constraints as hmms the potential problem with memms noticing a trend here p is that
computers that when the models are trained they are trained against correct previous labels that is when we create a classification example
computers example corresponding to the label at time t we include features that depend on the label at time t but these
computers these will always be correct at training time but can be wrong at test time this leads to the infamous label
computers label bias problem the conditional random field crf is essentially an answer to this problem instead of training to predict each
computers each label independently but then running viterbi at test time we train to get the whole sequence right this is a
computers a good instance of having identical training and testing situations training crfs is a bit of a bore since each iteration
computers iteration of training requires one to run the forward backward algorithm over each training instance but crfs do often perform better
computers better than plain memms the umass group has been nice enough to release their crf implementation once we get to crfs
computers crfs we can play a bunch of other games for instance we can essentially come up with a margin based version
computers version of the crf this is roughly like moving from maxent to svms the result is either max margin markov networks
computers networks or svmstruct depending on exactly how you formulate the problem the latter has a nice implementation available to play with
computers with so that s a whole lot of learning but where the action really is in the features for me there
computers there s essentially a standard feature set i always use for these problems and then add and subtract as i see
computers see fit the features i usually use are the ing with examples based on the word george the exact word george
computers george the stem george prefixes of length g ge and geo suffixes of length rge ge and e and some regexps
computers regexps the most useful i use is to transform all capital letters to a all lower case to a all numbers
computers numbers to and all punctuation to then we collapse identical adjacent letters so george aaaaaa aa finally i use list of
computers of people places and organizations collected from various gazetteers and check whether each word falls in any of these lists incidentally
computers incidentally these are available as part of my tagchunk program for solving joint tagging chunking problems all of these features are
computers are typically applied in a window of or words around the given word you can see exactly what i calculate in
computers in this perl script the final issue in features is what to do with the transition features in particular one can
computers can think of putting the lexical features on nodes or edges by putting them on nodes i mean that you have
computers have features like previous tag is dt current word is george current case is aa but you can also do a
computers a conjunction thing and say previous tag is dt current word is george and previous tag is dt current case is
computers is aa and previous tag is dt this obviously blows up your feature space but if you have enough data it
computers it s almost always worth doing now getting back to the segmentation issue the fact that there are multiple valid encodings
computers encodings for mapping segmentation raw labeling is probably a bad thing it seems that ideally we d like to learn to
computers to do the segmentation directly this is really not that hard and it comes with a bunch of benefits especially in
computers in what features you can employ for instance you can check if the whole string george bush falls in a list
computers list of names or you can notice that both words are capitalized these are both great phrase based features more evidence
computers evidence has been published that treating these problems as segmentation problems directly is beneficial the acl universe is now a wiki

computers has failed with powerset that s a search engine you can t even use at the moment but the hype will
computers will no doubt continue to counteract that my thoughts on and some history about natural language search natural language search makes
computers makes a compelling pitch for those who really don t know search or haven t heard the natural language mantra before
computers before i ve seen the pitch time and time again you pick out an example that shows how quot bad quot
computers quot search is on an existing search engine demonstrate how natural language search would work better on your service sit back
computers back and collect the press attention what are the problems with this first most searches are two to three words long
computers long you can t conceptually analyze them because there s simply not enough information to do so they aren t sentences
computers sentences where an ambiguous meaning becomes clear to a human that understands the context of the sentence consider these popular searches
computers searches out of the google zeitgeist or from ask iq or from yahoo buzz expedia pirates of the caribbean beach game
computers game cheats heidi klum halloween wigs what conceptual analysis are you going to do on them what context from quot beach

computers guess that a user might have these topics in mind the first movie the second movie a computer game the ride
computers ride at disneyland actual pirates that roamed the carribbean there are many more meanings and intentions but natural language analyze the
computers the four words quot pirates of the caribbean quot all you want you won t know exactly what concept someone has
computers has in mind from that analysis you can mind large sets of web data to guess at concepts that s completely
computers completely different than natural language analysis it s also something that s long been in practice with search engines consider this
computers this search for pirates of the caribbean at clusty see how clusty automatically analyzes the web results and produces quot clusters
computers clusters quot or topics click on those and you refine your search results here s the same thing pirates of the
computers the caribbean at ask that s actual conceptual search live in action and on the web now nor is it new
computers new refinement features like this have been available on major search engines in various ways for years to date they ve
computers ve never really taken off i don t know why perhaps presentation could be better sometimes the clustering isn t good
computers good enough alternatively they might just be too weird for users but i know this the completely different type of quot
computers quot conceptual quot searching natural language analysis has never caught on and probably won t for a very long time because
computers because of the limited data searchers provide now let s do the history bit this isn t as comprehensive as i
computers i would like simply because many of the pitches i ve gotten over the years haven t resulted in articles that
computers that s because i already knew the services weren t going anywhere so doing an article wasn t a good investment
computers investment of time still there s plenty left over excite is born with quot intelligent concept extraction quot the pitch being
computers being that excite would know certain words were related to different concepts apple as a fruit versus being a computer company
computers company and that this could be used to improve results excite still operates but fair to say that ice the tech
computers tech s acronym didn t help keep it from being eclipsed by the likes of google nor help it overtake yahoo
computers yahoo which predated excite ask jeeves is born it continues to be mistakenly described as a former quot natural language quot
computers quot search engine yes ask encouraged people to using long sentences to quot ask quot what they were looking for but
computers but you could do the same with all the other major search engines as well ask had more relevant result not
computers not from natural language processing but because it employed over editors to ensure they hand picked good answers to popular queries

computers the established players cringley gets all excited about meaningmaster scroll down here to see me sounding my usual skepticism let s
computers s look at his article for an example of the familiar natural language pitch meaningmaster is generating a lot of buzz
computers buzz in silicon valley yet another overnight sensation that was years in the making meaningmaster is the brainchild of kathleen dahlgren
computers dahlgren a computational linguistics phd who has spent most of her career building a lexicon of the english language this lexicon
computers lexicon is a computer dictionary that is purported to understand the meanings of more than english words in context quot we
computers we model the way people interpret the meanings of a word through context quot says ms dahlgren who is today ceo
computers ceo of meaningmaster quot we search on meaning by using grammar and structure and semantics every word has associated with it
computers it a set of beliefs quot i asked graham spencer to take a look at meaningmaster graham was the chief techie
computers techie at excite where he pioneered yet another search technique involving linguistic vector analysis that still offers some advantages too quot
computers quot it looks interesting quot said graham quot but i found it to have some obvious gaps the problem with any
computers any technology that tries to be explicitly smart is that it has to be really close to perfect or else a
computers a human will notice only time will tell if meaningmaster annoys users or delights them but if its real strength is
computers is for targeted advertising then the annoyance factor could be practically eliminated as long as advertisers were seeing improvements in converting
computers converting clicks into sales that s the real test i haven t heard much about meaningmaster since the company is still
computers still going i notice that contextual ads are one of the solutions it pitches the technology toward that s another familiar
computers familiar theme natural language technology originally designed to help searching ends up being an ad solution microsoft lets us know that
computers that natural language was going to be one of the ways it would kick some google butt from what i wrote
computers wrote about that pitch what about some recent statements by gates about linguistic analysis as a way forward they make a
computers a nice sound bite which is why would be search companies have said the same things in the past but such
computers such efforts have gone nowhere in my view this has been primarily because linguistic analysis of pages or natural language processing
computers processing isn t that important when dealing with the popular short queries people conduct like quot britney spears quot stochasto gets
computers gets some attention for having quot real natural language quot search nevertheless it s another company i haven t heard much
computers much about since kozoru gets lots of attention on a natural language like approach when the attention runs out it turns
computers turns into accusations that google s still checking them out after refusing calls and then how the blogosphere is ignoring them

computers the web nevertheless its artificial intelligence natural language searching technology hasn t helped the search engine attract searchers making no real
computers real gains in the us it recently began focusing on europe i really wish i had the time to dive even
computers even deeper into the actual press releases i ve been sent over the years the pitches the promises and so on
computers on suffice to say this any time someone pitches that they have some quot natural language quot revolutionary technology my eyes
computers eyes start to glaze over and my impression is that they know little about how web search actually operates currently and
computers and that brings us to powerset powerset has all the things you want for a start up success story unless you
computers you re pitching to me it s in secret they ve raised million in funding they ve got some prominent names
computers names behind them like esther dyson as an investor more on powerset the secretive search engine from venturebeat covers the back
computers back story i said these things don t work for me that s because i ve already seen prominent investors get
computers get involved with things that failed since they really weren t that useful i especially despise things that are in super
computers super double secret stealth mode you want respect when you haven t already proven yourself in the search world you roll
computers roll out a product that people can play with fairly quickly otherwise you re simply kozuru squandering your initial hype i
computers i m also already put off by the fact that quot natural search quot will be the advanced technique that s
computers s going to have you beat google despite the fact you ve got nothing to analyze and the field is littered
computers littered with other companies who already tried this from powerset itself we ve got barney pell explaining more in the powerset
computers powerset and natural language search on his blog pell does address things i ve already covered people don t enter many
computers many words and that natural search hasn t worked before but he argues still going ahead doesn t defy conventional wisdom
computers wisdom since google did the same thing in challenging the majors not correct google succeeded because the changes it made required
computers required no changes on the part of the user the results simply got better even though the method of searching and
computers and number of words remained the same it also succeeded because all the other major players weren t paying attention to
computers to search believe me they aren t ignoring the idea of natural language search they know about it and if it
computers it will be successful you bet it will be implemented long before an upstart company can try to trounce them back
computers back to pell s post he fails to explain how searchers are somehow magically going to go beyond quot keywordese quot
computers quot to natural language searching they aren t using keywordese now because they somehow have been trained to do it no
computers no one from google sat the searchers down and said quot only two words and don t use conjunctions quot people
computers people search however they want and right now they use only a few words if powerset s going to change those
computers those habits good luck be sure to read my why search sucks amp you won t fix it the way you
computers you think post from last which graphically illustrates the challenge in changing habits with the user interface alone getting inside the
computers the minds and whispering quot type longer quot isn t going to be fun meanwhile i have great sympathy for the
computers the fact that the major search engines could definitely do a much better job with query refinement my robert scoble wants
computers wants what we had better query refinement so do i post from last year drills deep into some of the things
computers things i ve illustrated above on how query refinement could improve and improve in a way that wouldn t cause more
computers more work for the searchers meanwhile i ll leave off with this screenshot that s the top of ask s search
computers search results for the pirates of the caribbean search i mentioned earlier notice what they show before the regular search results
computers results a big fat guess at what most people probably want the info on the latest movie did they guess wrong
computers wrong notice the quot did you mean quot link directing searchers to try a search on xbox related info as a
computers a backup that s query refinement in action inline directly in front of the action area that most searchers interact with
computers with it could be much much better but it s a start and you re going to see more of this

computers concerned overview the goal of the natural language processing nlp group is to design and build software that will analyze understand
computers understand and generate languages that humans use naturally so that eventually you will be able to address your computer as though
computers though you were addressing another person this goal is not easy to reach understanding language means among other things knowing what
computers what concepts a word or phrase stands for and knowing how to link those concepts together in a meaningful way it
computers it s ironic that natural language the symbol system that is easiest for humans to learn and use is hardest for
computers for a computer to master long after machines have proven capable of inverting large matrices with speed and grace they still
computers still fail to master the basics of our spoken and languages the challenges we face stem from the highly ambiguous nature
computers nature of natural language as an english speaker you effortlessly understand a sentence like flying planes can be dangerous yet this
computers this sentence presents difficulties to a software program that lacks both your knowledge of the world and your experience with linguistic
computers linguistic structures is the more plausible interpretation that the pilot is at risk or that the danger is to people on

computers technologies which offer features and precision that you just don t get from generic search engines there s a lot going
computers going on in these rather cool products in broad outline mercado and inquira each combine three basic search approaches generic text
computers text indexing augmentation via an ontology a rules engine that helps the site owner determine which results and responses are shown
computers shown under various circumstances of the two inquira seems to have the more sophisticated ontology indeed the not wholly absurd claim
computers claim is that inquira does natural language processing nlp both vendors incorporate user information in deciding which search results to show
computers show in ways that may be harbingers of what generic search engines like google and yahoo will do down the road

computers description of text mining in to describe text analytics the latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while
computers while text mining is used in some of the earliest application areas dating to the s notably life sciences research and
computers and government intelligence the term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems whether independently
computers independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded numerical data it is a truism that percent of business relevant
computers relevant information originates in unstructured form primarily text these techniques and processes discover and present knowledge facts business rules and relationships

computers processing machines for auto abstracting and auto encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the action points
computers points in an organization both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted characterized by a word pattern and sent automatically
computers automatically to appropriate action points yet as management information systems developed starting in the s and as bi emerged in the
computers the s and s as a software category and field of practice the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational
computers relational databases this is not surprising text in unstructured documents is hard to process the emergence of text analytics in its
computers its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late s from algorithm development to application as described by
computers by prof marti a hearst in the paper untangling text data mining for almost a decade the computational linguistics community has
computers has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms in this
computers this paper i have attempted to suggest a new emphasis the use of large online text collections to discover new facts
computers facts and trends about the world itself i suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text
computers text analysis rather a mixture of computationally driven and user guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results information
computers information retrieval or identification of a corpus is a preparatory step collecting or identifying a set of textual materials on the

computers knowledge in text data mining research assumes that the information to be mined is already in the form of a relational
computers relational database unfortunately for many applications available electronic information is in the form of unstructured natural language documents rather than structured
computers structured databases consequently the problem of text mining i e discovering useful knowledge from unstructured text is becoming an increasingly impor

computers installment of this three part series i looked at windows vista kernel enhancements in the areas of processes and i o
computers o this time i ll cover advances in the way windows vista manages memory as well as major improvements to system
computers system startup shutdown and power management part every release of windows improves scalability and performance and windows vista is no different
computers different the windows vista memory manager includes numerous enhancements like more extensive use of lock free synchronization techniques finer grained locking
computers locking tighter data structure packing larger paging i os support for modern gpu memory architectures and more efficient use of the
computers the hardware translation lookaside buffer plus windows vista memory management now offers dynamic address space allocation for the requirements of different
computers different workloads four performance enhancing features that use new technologies make their operating system debut on windows vista superfetch readyboost readyboot
computers readyboot and readydrive i ll discuss them in detail later in this article dynamic kernel address space windows and the applications
computers applications that run on it have bumped their heads on the address space limits of bit processors the windows kernel is
computers is constrained by default to gb or half the total bit virtual address space with the other half reserved for use
computers use by the process whose thread is currently running on the cpu inside its half the kernel has to map itself
computers itself device drivers the file system cache kernel stacks per session code data structures and both non paged locked in physical
computers physical memory and paged buffers allocated by device drivers prior to windows vista the memory manager determined at boot time how
computers how much of the address space to assign to these different purposes but this inflexibility sometimes led to situations where one
computers one of the regions became full while others still had plenty of available space the exhaustion of an area can lead
computers lead to application failures and prevent device drivers from completing i o operations in bit windows vista the memory manager dynamically
computers dynamically manages the kernel s address space allocating and deallocating space to various uses as the demands of the workload require
computers require thus the amount of virtual memory used to store paged buffers can grow when device drivers ask for more and
computers and it can shrink when the drivers release it windows vista will therefore be able to handle a wider variety of
computers of workloads and likewise the bit version of the forthcoming windows server code named longhorn will scale to handle more concurrent
computers concurrent terminal server users of course on bit windows vista systems address space constraints are not currently a practical limitation and
computers and therefore require no special treatment as they are configured to their maximums memory priorities just as windows vista adds i
computers i o priorities as i discussed in the last installment it also implements memory priorities understanding how windows uses memory priorities
computers priorities requires grasping how the memory manager implements its memory cache called the standby list on all versions of windows prior
computers prior to windows vista when a physical page which is typically kb in size that s owned by a process was
computers was reclaimed by the system the memory manager typically placed the page at the end of the standby list if the
computers the process wanted to access the page again the memory manager took the page from the standby list and reassigned it
computers it to the process when a process wanted to use a new page of physical memory and no free memory was
computers was available the memory manager gave it the page at the front the standby list this scheme treated all pages on
computers on the standby essentially as equals using only the time they were placed on the list to sort them on windows
computers windows vista every page of memory has a priority in the range of to and so the memory manager divides the
computers the standby list into eight lists that each store pages of a particular priority when the memory manager wants to take
computers take a page from the standby list it pages from low priority lists first a page s priority usually reflects that
computers that of the thread that first causes its allocation if the page is shared it reflects the highest of memory priorities
computers priorities of the sharing threads a thread inherits its page priority value from the process to which it belongs the memory
computers memory manager uses low priorities for pages it reads from disk speculatively when anticipating a process s memory accesses by default
computers default processes have a page priority value of but functions allow applications and the system to change process and thread page
computers page priority values the real power of memory priorities is realized only when the relative priorities of pages are understood at
computers at a macro level which is the role of superfetch superfetch a significant change to the memory manager is in the
computers the way that it manages physical memory the standby list management used by previous versions of windows has two limitations first
computers first the prioritization of pages relies only on the recent past behavior of processes and does not anticipate their future memory
computers memory requirements second the data used for prioritization is limited to the list of pages owned by a process at any
computers any given point in time these shortcomings can result in scenarios like the after lunch syndrome where you leave your computer
computers computer for a while and a memory intensive system application runs such as an antivirus scan or disk defragmentation this application
computers application forces the code and data that your active applications had cached in memory to be over by the memory intensive
computers intensive activities when you return you experience sluggish performance as applications have to request their data and code from disk windows
computers windows xp introduced prefetching support that improved boot and application startup performance by performing large disk i os to preload memory
computers memory with code and file system data that it expected based on previous boots and application launches windows vista goes a
computers a big step further with superfetch a memory management scheme that enhances the least recently accessed approach with historical information and
computers and proactive memory management superfetch is implemented in systemroot system sysmain dll as a windows service that runs inside a service
computers service host process systemroot system svchost exe the scheme relies on support from the memory manager so that it can retrieve
computers retrieve page usage histories as well as direct the memory manager to preload data and code from files on disk or
computers or from a paging file into the standby list and assign priorities to pages the superfetch service essentially extends page tracking
computers tracking to data and code that was once in memory but that the memory manager has reused to make room for
computers for new data and code it stores this information in scenario files with a db extension in the systemroot prefetch directory
computers directory alongside standard prefetch files used to optimize application launch using this deep knowledge of memory usage superfetch can preload data
computers data and code when physical memory becomes available whenever memory becomes free for example when an application exits or releases memory
computers memory superfetch asks the memory manager to fetch data and code that was recently evicted this is done at a rate
computers rate of a few pages per second with very low priority i os so that the preloading does not impact the
computers the user or other active applications therefore if you leave your computer to go to lunch and a memory intensive background
computers background task causes the code and data from your active applications to be evicted from memory while you re gone superfetch
computers superfetch can often bring all or most of it back into memory before you return superfetch also includes specific scenario support
computers support for hibernation standby fast user switching fus and application launch when the system hibernates for example superfetch stores data and
computers and code in the hibernation file that it expects based on previous hibernations will be accessed during the subsequent resume in
computers in contrast when you resume windows xp previously cached data must be reread from the disk when it is referenced see
computers see the sidebar watching superfetch for a glimpse of how superfetch impacts available memory watching superfetch after you ve used a
computers a windows vista system a while you ll see a low number for the free physical memory counter on task manager
computers manager s performance page that s because superfetch and standard windows caching make use of all available physical memory to cache
computers cache disk data for example when you first boot if you immediately run task manager you should notice the free memory
computers memory value decreasing as cached memory number rises or if you run a memory hungry program and then exit it any
computers any of the freeware ram optimizers that allocate large amounts of memory and then release the memory will work or just
computers just copy a very large file the free number will rise and the physical memory usage graph will drop as the
computers the system reclaims the deallocated memory over time however superfetch repopulates the cache with the data that was forced out of
computers of memory so the cached number will rise and the free number will decline watching memory click the image for a
computers a smaller view watching memory click the image for a larger view readyboost the speed of cpus and memory are fast
computers fast outpacing that of hard disks so disks are a common system performance bottleneck random disk i o is especially expensive
computers expensive because disk head seek times are on the order of milliseconds an eternity for today s ghz processors while ram
computers ram is ideal for caching disk data it is relatively expensive flash memory however is generally cheaper and can service random
computers random reads up to times faster than a typical hard disk windows vista therefore includes a feature called readyboost to take
computers take advantage of flash memory storage devices by creating an intermediate caching layer on them that logically sits between memory and
computers and disks readyboost consists of a service implemented in systemroot system emdmgmt dll that runs in a service host process and
computers and a volume filter driver systemroot system drivers ecache sys emd is short for external memory device the working name for
computers for readyboost during its development when you insert a flash device like a usb key into a system the readyboost service
computers service looks at the device to determine its performance characteristics and stores the results of its test in hkey local machine
computers machine software microsoft windows nt currentversion emdmgmt seen in figure figure readyboost device test results in the registry click the image
computers image for a smaller view figure readyboost device test results in the registry click the image for a larger view if
computers if you aren t already using a device for caching and the new device is between mb and gb in size
computers size has a transfer rate of mb s or higher for random kb reads and has a transfer rate of mb
computers mb s or higher for random kb writes then readyboost will ask if you d like to dedicate up to gb
computers gb of the storage for disk caching although readyboost can use ntfs it limits the maximum cache size to gb to
computers to accommodate fat limitations if you agree then the service creates a caching file named readyboost sfcache in the root of
computers of the device and asks superfetch to prepopulate the cache in the background after the readyboost service initializes caching the ecache
computers ecache sys device driver intercepts all reads and writes to local hard disk volumes c for example and copies any data
computers data being into the caching file that the service created ecache sys compresses data and typically achieves a compression ratio so
computers so a gb cache file will usually contain gb of data the driver encrypts each block it writes using advanced encryption
computers encryption standard aes encryption with a randomly generated per boot session key in order to guarantee the privacy of the data
computers data in the cache if the device is removed from the system when readyboost sees random reads that can be satisfied
computers satisfied from the cache it services them from there but because hard disks have better sequential read access than flash memory
computers memory it lets reads that are part of sequential access patterns go directly to the disk even if the data is
computers is in the cache readyboot windows vista uses the same boot time prefetching as windows xp did if the system has
computers has less than mb of memory but if the system has mb or more of ram it uses an in ram
computers ram cache to optimize the boot process the size of the cache depends on the total ram available but is large
computers large enough to create a reasonable cache and yet allow the system the memory it needs to boot smoothly after every
computers every boot the readyboost service the same service that implements the readyboost feature just described uses idle cpu time to calculate
computers calculate a boot time caching plan for the next boot it analyzes file trace information from the five previous boots and
computers and identifies which files were accessed and where they are located on disk it stores the processed traces in systemroot prefetch
computers prefetch readyboot as fx files and saves the caching plan under hklm system currentcontrolset services ecache parameters in reg binary values
computers values named for internal disk volumes they refer to the cache is implemented by the same device driver that implements readyboost
computers readyboost caching ecache sys but the cache s population is guided by the readyboost service as the system boots while the
computers the boot cache is compressed like the readyboost cache another difference between readyboost and readyboot cache management is that while in
computers in readyboot mode other than the readyboost service s updates the cache doesn t change to reflect data that s read
computers read or during the boot the readyboost service deletes the cache seconds after the start of the boot or if other
computers other memory demands warrant it and records the cache s statistics in hklm system currentcontrolset services ecache parameters readybootstats as shown
computers shown in figure microsoft performance tests show that readyboot provides performance improvements of about percent over the legacy windows xp prefetcher

computers hdds an h hdd is a disk with embedded nonvolatile flash memory also known as nvram typical h hdds include between
computers between mb and mb of cache but the windows vista cache limit is tb windows vista uses ata commands to define
computers define the disk data to be held in the flash memory for example windows vista will save boot data to the
computers the cache when the system shuts down allowing for faster restarting it also stores portions of hibernation file data in the
computers the cache when the system hibernates so that the subsequent resume is faster because the cache is enabled even when the
computers the disk is spun down windows can use the flash memory as a disk write cache which avoids spinning up the
computers the disk when the system is running on battery power keeping the disk spindle turned off can save much of the
computers the power consumed by the disk drive under normal usage boot configuration database windows vista has enhanced several aspects of startup

computers windows vista shutdown changes include pre shutdown notification for windows services windows services shutdown ordering and a significant change to the
computers the way the os manages power state transitions one of the most visible changes to the startup process is the absence
computers absence of boot ini from the root of the system volume that s because the boot configuration which on previous versions
computers versions of windows was stored in the boot ini text file is now stored in the bcd one of the reasons
computers reasons windows vista uses the bcd is that it unifies the two current boot architectures supported by windows master boot record
computers record mbr and extensible firmware interface efi mbr is generally used by x and x desktop systems while efi is used
computers used by itanium based systems though desktop pcs are likely to ship with efi support in the near future the bcd
computers bcd abstracts the firmware and has other advantages over boot ini like its support for unicode strings and alternate pre boot
computers boot executables the bcd is actually stored on disk in a registry hive that loads into the windows registry for access
computers access via registry apis on pcs windows stores it in boot bcd on the system volume on efi systems it s
computers s on the efi system partition when the hive is loaded it appears under hklm bcd but its internal format is
computers is undocumented so editing it requires the use of a tool like systemroot system bcdedit exe interfaces for manipulating the bcd
computers bcd are also made available for scripts and custom editors through windows management instrumentation wmi and you can use the windows
computers windows system configuration utility systemroot system msconfig exe to edit or add basic parameters like kernel debugging options the bcd divides
computers divides platform wide boot settings like the default os selection and the boot menu timeout from os specific settings such as
computers as os boot options and the path to the os boot loader for example figure shows that when you run bcdedit
computers bcdedit with no command line options it displays platform settings in the windows boot manager section at the top of the
computers the output ed by os specific settings in the windows boot loader section figure settings displayed in bcdedit click the image
computers image for a smaller view figure settings displayed in bcdedit click the image for a larger view when you boot a
computers a windows vista installation this new scheme divides the tasks that were handled by the operating system loader ntldr on previous
computers previous versions of windows into two different executables bootmgr and systemroot system winload exe bootmgr reads the bcd and displays the
computers the os boot menu while winload exe handles operating system loading if you re performing a clean boot winload exe loads
computers loads boot start device drivers and core operating system files including ntoskrnl exe and transfers control to the operating system if
computers if the system is resuming from hibernation then it executes systemroot system winresume exe to load the hibernation data into memory
computers memory and resume the os bootmgr also includes support for additional pre boot executables windows vista comes with the windows memory
computers memory diagnostic boot memtest exe pre configured as an option for checking the health of ram but third parties can add
computers add their own pre boot executables as options that will display in bootmgr s boot menu startup processes in previous versions
computers versions of windows the relationship between various system processes was unintuitive for example as the system boots the interactive logon manager
computers manager systemroot system winlogon exe launches the local security authority subsystem service lsass exe and the service control manager services exe
computers exe further windows uses a namespace container called a session to isolate processes running in different logon sessions but prior to
computers to windows vista the user logged into the console shared session the session used by system processes which created potential security
computers security issues one such issue was introduced for example when a poorly windows service running in session displayed a user interface
computers interface on the interactive console allowing malware to attack the window through techniques like shatter attacks and possibly gain administrative privileges
computers privileges to address these problems several system processes were re architected for windows vista session manager smss exe is the first
computers first user mode process created during the boot as in previous versions of windows but on windows vista the session manager
computers manager launches a second instance of itself to configure session which is dedicated solely to system processes the session manager process
computers process for session launches the windows startup application wininit exe a windows subsystem process csrss exe for session and then it
computers it exits the windows startup application continues by starting the service control manager the local security authority subsystem and a new
computers new process local session manager lsm exe which manages terminal server connections for the machine when a user logs onto the
computers the system the initial session manager creates a new instance of itself to configure the new session the new smss exe
computers exe process starts a windows subsystem process and winlogon process for the new session having the primary session manager use copies
computers copies of itself to initialize new sessions doesn t offer any advantages on a client system but on windows server longhorn
computers longhorn systems acting as terminal servers multiple copies can run concurrently to allow for faster logon of multiple users with this
computers this new architecture system processes including windows services are isolated in session if a windows service which runs in session displays
computers displays a user interface the interactive services detection service systemroot system ui detect exe notifies any logged on administrator by launching
computers launching an instance of itself in the user s security context and displaying the message shown in figure if the user
computers user selects the show me the message button the service switches the desktop to the windows service desktop where the user
computers user can interact with the service s user interface and then switch back to their own desktop for more on what
computers what happens at startup see the sidebar viewing startup process relationships figure service has displayed a window click the image for

computers is the initial smss exe below it is the session csrss exe and wininit exe which are left justified because their
computers their parent process the instance of smss exe that configured session has exited wininit s three children are services exe lsass

computers click the image for a larger view credential providers even the logon architecture is changed on windows vista on previous versions
computers versions of windows the winlogon process loaded the graphical identification and authentication gina dll specified in the registry to display a
computers a logon ui that asked users for their credentials unfortunately the gina model suffers from several limitations including the fact that
computers that only one gina can be configured writing a complete gina is difficult for third parties and custom ginas that have
computers have non standard user interfaces change the windows user experience instead of a gina windows vista uses the new credential provider
computers provider architecture winlogon launches a separate process the logon user interface host logonui exe that loads credential providers that are configured
computers configured in hkey local machine software microsoft windows nt currentversion authentication credential providers logonui can host multiple credential providers concurrently in
computers in fact windows vista ships with interactive authui dll and smartcard smart cardcredentialprovider dll providers to ensure a uniform user experience
computers experience logonui manages the user interface that is displayed to end users but it also allows credential providers to specify custom
computers custom elements like text icons and edit controls delayed autostart services if you ve ever logged onto a windows system immediately
computers immediately after it starts you ve probably experienced delays before your desktop is fully configured and you can interact with the
computers the shell and any applications you launch while you re logging on the service control manager is starting the many windows
computers windows services that are configured as automatic start services and therefore activate at boot time many services perform cpu and disk
computers disk intensive initializations that compete with your logon activities to accommodate this windows vista introduces a new service start type called
computers called delayed automatic start which services can use if they don t have to be active immediately after windows boots the
computers the service control manager starts services configured for delayed automatic start after the automatic start services have finished starting and it
computers it sets the priority of their initial thread to thread priority lowest this priority level causes all the disk i o
computers o the thread performs to be very low i o priority after a service finishes initializing the service control manager sets
computers sets its priority to normal the combination of the delayed start low cpu and memory priority and background disk priority greatly
computers greatly reduce interference with a user s logon many windows services including background intelligent transfer windows update client and windows media
computers media center use the new start type to help improve the performance of logons after a boot shutdown a problem that
computers that s plagued windows service writers is that during a windows shutdown they have by default a maximum of twenty seconds
computers seconds to perform cleanup versions of windows prior to windows vista haven t supported a clean shutdown that waits for all
computers all services to exit because a buggy service can hold up a shutdown indefinitely some services like those that have network
computers network related shutdown operations or have to save large amounts of data to disk might require more time and so windows
computers windows vista allows a service to request pre shutdown notification when windows vista shuts down the service control manager first notifies
computers notifies those services asking for pre shutdown notification it will wait indefinitely for these services to exit but if they have
computers have a bug and don t respond to queries the service control manager gives up and moves on after three minutes
computers minutes once all those services have exited or the timeout has expired the service control manager proceeds with legacy style services
computers services shutdown for the rest of the services the group policy and windows update services register pre shutdown notification in a
computers a fresh windows vista installation the group policy and windows update services also use another windows vista services feature shutdown ordering
computers ordering services have always been able to specify startup dependencies that the service control manager honors to start services in an
computers an order that satisfies them but until windows vista they have been unable to specify shutdown dependencies now services that register
computers register for pre shutdown notification can also insert themselves into the list stored at hklm system currentcontrolset control preshutdownorder and the
computers the service control manager will shut them down according to their order see the sidebar identifying a delayed autostart and pre
computers pre shutdown service for more on these services power management sleep and hibernate are other forms of shutdown and buggy power
computers power management in drivers and applications has been the curse of road warriors since windows introduced power management to the windows
computers windows nt based line of windows operating systems many users have expected their laptop system to suspend or hibernate when they
computers they closed the lid before embarking on a trip only to arrive at their destination with a hot carrying case a
computers a dead battery and lost data that s because windows has always asked device drivers and applications for their consent to
computers to change power state and a single unresponsive driver or application could prevent a transition in windows vista the kernel s
computers s power manager still informs drivers and applications of power state changes so that they can prepare for them but it
computers it no longer asks for permission in addition the power manager waits at most seconds for applications to respond to change
computers change notifications rather than the two minutes it waited on previous versions of windows as a result windows vista users can
computers can be more confident that their systems are honoring hibernations and suspends next up as mentioned earlier this is the second

computers strategy already impacting google by emre sokullu and edited by richard macmanus windows vista is finally out and along with that
computers that microsoft seems to have kick started its vista live joint initiative this initiative aims to push microsoft s new web
computers web properties in tandem with their dominant windows operating system and so become a leader in the web industry as well
computers well basically this means that microsoft makes its windows live web properties the default in windows vista pcs where possible for
computers for example live search is the default search engine in ie on new vista machines but the question is will this
computers this strategy be enough for microsoft to beat google and yahoo in the web race or will the average joe and
computers and jane user with their new vista pc make the extra effort to change their default search engine back to google
computers google again in this article we will analyze the early results of microsoft s vista live strategy after the official releases
computers releases of ie and windows vista this year our data source is alexa which is known to be not overly reliable
computers reliable but it is quite adequate when making comparisons between leading sites like google and microsoft before starting with the graphs
computers graphs let s remind you of the official release dates ie was released and offered to the public on november windows
computers windows vista for businesses was made available on november windows vista for consumers was made available on january keeping in mind
computers mind these dates let s take a look at the ing graphs the vertical red lines roughly show windows vista s
computers s release date measuring vista s impact on microsoft web properties live com msn com the graphs above indicate a clear
computers clear gain for microsoft s live and msn in both of the graphs after the red line indicating vista s release
computers release traffic sharply rises shown by the green tangents and interestingly both tangents have the same slope live s slope is
computers is msn s is this hints that the growth in both live and msn are not by chance measuring vista s
computers s impact on google web properties on the other hand google indicates a reverse trend according to alexa there is a
computers a significant fall in google s traffic after vista was released the blue line shows the resistance google s slope is
computers is a negative measuring vista s impact on yahoo web properties yahoo seems to be relatively unaffected although its alexa chart
computers chart has been sloping ever so slightly downward for the past year or two discussion is microsoft pushing google down the
computers the alexa graphs show a clear win situation for microsoft s vista live strategy where live products are the default on
computers on vista machines although it may be too early to judge history repeats itself and people who migrate to vista seem
computers seem happy with what is given as the default i e the default experience is good enough looking at this from
computers from google s perspective though even though vista uses live search as its default in ie making google your default search
computers search engine is just one click away and an alert will display when you visit the google homepage with ie windows
computers windows live is crucial to microsoft in their battle with google as proven by their big internet marketing campaign for live
computers live even though they haven t nailed the branding yet at the same time google s underlying technology pagerank is becoming
computers becoming a commodity yahoo and microsoft are getting closer to google s search quality also open source alternatives like nutch and
computers and dmoz are beginning to blossom similar in a way to windows vs linux in other words the quality gap is
computers is getting negligible between google search and the competition having said that gmail and google office are new ish tools that
computers that can help drive visitors back to google so the battle is happening on many fronts the reason why yahoo seems
computers seems unaffected is obvious yahoo is not in direct competition with microsoft they could even be considered allies yahoo is preferred
computers preferred by consumers for mail finance and other portal products and these products have never really been presented as defaults on
computers on the pc either you visited the sites by yourself or you installed a browser endorsed by yahoo as a final
computers final note alexa competitor compete s results are in parallel with ours according to compete these giants all have an increasing
computers increasing trend in page views but google s slope is apparently lower than those of msn and live what do you
computers you think is microsoft s vista live strategy already beginning to affect google s dominance in search and other web properties
computers properties albeit only with a slight downturn at this point or has google got too much of a lead on the
computers the web for even microsoft s os dominance to turn it around and trend google downwards long term audio digg this

computers subscribe to comments for this post or subscribe to comments for all read writeweb posts i m wondering if google s
computers s slide down after fresh installs of ie is possibly due at least in part to people having the google toolbar
computers toolbar installed in ie and then suddenly not having it in the new computer thus a sharp downward motion for google
computers google while it s replaced by live that being said it would make sense that at least some of these google
computers google toolbar users would reinstall the toolbar at some point many might just think oh well i have something else that
computers that works good enough and never bother to reinstall just something i m thinking but have no idea how it could
computers could be measured of course if google releases an updated toolbar soon it might give some momentum back to them and
computers and we would see that in a graph too posted by devon young february pm i think it is inevitable there
computers there will be some shift from google to microsoft live but how great a shift will come done to a perception
computers perception of how good the search results are in the past weeks i ve noticed at least a doubling of visits
computers visits to my site via live from a tiny base relative to visits via google and still small but a very
computers very noticeable jump my flatmate has had vista also for weeks now and when i ve tried it and when she
computers she uses it we ve just used the default live search to give it a go and think many people will
computers will do this then if they are getting useful results there is less reason for them to put any effort into
computers into changing particularly in the case of the average user additionally personally i am finding a growing number of cases where
computers where i n not getting useful results from a google search today even with changing my search terms couldn t find
computers find what i wanted in the first google results so gave up in the end will have to resort to some
computers some old fashioned telephone research tomorrow posted by bryan jones february pm google has become more arrogant than microsoft in the
computers the last years their adsense policy their search engine deindex bans without valid reasons live has becoming an alternative to google
computers google and with the change from xp to vista that will grow alot more it s time for google treat the
computers the users a little better they must remember that if they have success is only because of the users webmasters of
computers of this world and they are not god i hope that live become a more solid alternative but not to turn
computers turn another google god posted by jonix konios february pm forgot to say something if these graphs are true i believe
computers believe so but i m still skeptic and this trend continues then google may consider a googleos as we described in
computers in our previous articles posted by emre sokullu february pm google is a rotten whore and i sincerely hope they lose
computers lose many market share points to microsoft and others posted by kylie manders february pm wow emre this is great stuff
computers stuff alex posted by alex iskold february pm very compelling thanks for the in depth posted by jim february pm i
computers i am doubting whether microsoft will get sue for monopolizing the os hopefully it will posted by pohee com february am
computers am as far as live search is concerned vista s integration of live search as the default starting in ie should
computers should help so much of search traffic is convenience based users just type whatever search they have in mind in the
computers the first search box in front of them as long as acceptable google and yahoo have made such an effort to
computers to educate users with other choices right from ie serving rich dynamic calls to action to add theirs in the drop
computers drop down i think the jury s still out for sure firefox is doing a lot of good for google as
computers as well now i am not saying that all searches are convenience based many of preference based more emotionally loaded for
computers for searchers that they ll make an effort to go to their primary preferred engine to search arnaud posted by arnnaud
computers arnnaud fischer february am thanks alex and jim pohee i don t think microsoft is monopolizing something here it gives you
computers you the choice to change your search engine with just one click firefox had a default as well but we never
computers never called google monopolist posted by emre sokullu february am ya ll just ain t never gonna learn are ya microsoft
computers microsoft must enjoy being in courtrooms or they have selective memory since this is exactly what got them busted when they
computers they illegally crushed little tiny netscape but this time they are trying to do it to a company with almost unlimited
computers unlimited cash to spend p s there is a pool here in the office to define when microsoft jumped the shark
computers shark some say it was with the zune some say vista i say the point in time when we look back
computers back and say that was the end of microsoft is going to be the zune phone posted by todd february am
computers am interesting post microsoft is definitely having an impact i notice now on my site are coming from microsoft s default
computers default browser it has just clicked as to exactly what is happening hmmm posted by adrian keys february am i am
computers am pretty surprised by this microsoft really is trying to get back into the playing field after releasing vista posted by
computers by luis february pm good article emre i would like to revisit this analyis in s and see whether the impact
computers impact is as great certainly the initial inpact on googles turf looks quite significant and if it continues live may become
computers become a major player in the search engine business posted by cathal o brien february pm but google isn t a
computers a tiny company while microsoft launches the opening salvos of the search engine wars google is apparently ramping up to launch
computers launch a first strike on office s stranglehold so let s watch these too stab each other in the neck and
computers and see who wins posted by daxtermguy february pm our data source is alexa which is known to be not overly
computers overly reliable but it is quite adequate when making comparisons between leading sites like google and microsoft i think you ll
computers ll have to use other sources as well before drawing any firm conclusions posted by juha february pm doh didn t
computers t close the strong tag properly up there sorry about that posted by juha february pm fixed that juha posted by
computers by richard macmanus february pm live hit the market for consumers less than a ago and the trends appear that google
computers google is experiencing the same same downward road it took last year at this time if we attribute this dip in
computers in browsing for google in early to live how can we explain why usership was down first quarter of like anything
computers anything else the trends are set and then observed with the eventual last line finally absorbing the products myself and of
computers of the regular people i know still do not have vista nor have i even seen it used beyond a few
computers few youtube demonstrations as vista comes down in price and more people upgrade their machines to it the next few years
computers years what is the likelihood that the less tech savvy masses many of whom use google but could just as easily
computers easily use anything else will take the time or have the knowledge to switch from live which will already be installed
computers installed and assumably will be good enough and simple enough for their liking posted by ditty february pm i think live
computers live is going to grow in popularity but never beat google posted by edwin february pm does anyone here know how
computers how to get by the activation part of loading internet explorer i have windows xp professional and yeah its a pirated
computers pirated copy posted by ronald february pm this is a very inaccurate interpretation of the alexa graphs you have no explanation
computers explanation for the fall in the google com graph for the first quarter of the trend you describe is non existing
computers existing as this easily could be other factors or natural fluctuations it is in no way correct graph interpretation to zoom
computers zoom in on such a small piece of the graph and only investigate one factor posted by mikkel funck february pm
computers pm i do not like gmail i agree its great application and all the advantages but at the same time i
computers i do not like it when gmail puts all sorts of ads next to my mail depending on its contents its
computers its like somebody is sneaking up on you all the time i prefer yahoo mail for that posted by bb february
computers february pm bb its like somebody is sneaking up on you all the time i prefer yahoo mail for that heh
computers heh yeah and yahoo does just that google for yahoo web beacons and check it out i moderate a yahoo group
computers group for journalists and make a point of reading messages in plain text only no can t move the group before
computers before anyone asks posted by juha february pm mikkel of course we can t say our interpretations are absolutely true and
computers and we already make this disclosure in the introduction but you should admit that it is very likely that these interpretations
computers interpretations are right yes it s too early to judge but ing s will tell if we are right or not
computers not posted by emre sokullu february pm bb why do people like you complain about ads in gmail all free email
computers email providers need ads to sustain the service whats more using firefox you can easily disable ads in gmail using customizegoogle
computers customizegoogle addon stop being a complaining fool and do something about it posted by cali february pm the growth in ms
computers ms traffic is undeniable but you have to be careful here first presidents day and most every change traffic patterns second
computers second people are likely to try new features in vista because they are new that doesn t mean they will stick
computers stick with it posted by alan keister february am you think so maybe affecting google positively the pie is just getting
computers getting bigger and googles piece is big posted by phil b february pm one is not enough statistical evidence to support
computers support a trend posted by erwen tang february pm this analysis isn t very meaningful firstly there aren t enough data
computers data points we are talking less than mths of data and in case of consumer version mth there s no explanation
computers explanation given for similar dips in the google chart over the last year lastly yahoo is not in direct competition with
computers with microsoft um neither is google except when it comes to search all three are competitors posted by mia d february

computers level facilities it is a statically typed free form multi paradigm language supporting procedural data abstraction object oriented programming generic programming
computers programming and rtti since the s c has been one of the most popular commercial programming languages bjarne stroustrup developed c
computers c originally named c with classes in at bell labs as an enhancement to the c language enhancements started with the
computers the addition of classes ed by among other features virtual functions operator overloading multiple inheritance templates and exception handling the c
computers c programming language standard was ratified in as iso iec the current version of which is the version iso iec a
computers a new version of the standard known informally as c x is being developed contents history the name c future development

computers operators preprocessor preprocessor directives and macros templates objects encapsulation inheritance polymorphism parsing and processing c source code problems and controversies see
computers see also more information miscellaneous references external links materials tutorials electronic books support other libraries and code repositories history stroustrup began
computers began work on c with classes in the idea of creating a new language originated from stroustrup s experience in for
computers for his ph d thesis stroustrup found that simula had features that were very helpful for large software development but the
computers the language was too slow for practical use while bcpl was fast but too low level and unsuitable for large software
computers software development when stroustrup started working in bell labs he had the problem of analyzing the unix kernel with respect to
computers to distributed computing remembering his ph d experience stroustrup set out to enhance the c language with simula like features c
computers c was chosen because it is general purpose fast and portable besides c and simula some other languages which inspired him
computers him were algol ada clu and ml at first the class derived class strong type checking inlining and default argument features
computers features were added to c via cfront the first commercial release occurred in october in the name of the language was
computers was changed from c with classes to c new features were added including virtual functions function name and operator overloading references
computers references constants user controlled free store memory control improved type checking and a new single line comment style with two forward
computers forward slashes in the first edition of the c language was released providing an important reference to the language as there
computers there was not yet an official standard in release of c was released new features included multiple inheritance abstract classes static
computers static member functions const member functions and protected members in the annotated c reference manual was published this work became the
computers the basis for the future standard late addition of features included templates exceptions namespaces new casts and a boolean type as
computers as the c language evolved a standard library also evolved with it the first addition to the c standard library was
computers was the stream i o library which provided facilities to replace the traditional c functions such as printf and scanf later
computers later among the most significant additions to the standard library was the standard template library after years of work a joint
computers joint ansi iso committee standardized c in iso iec for some years after the official release of the standard in the
computers the committee processed defect reports and published a corrected version of the c standard in in a technical report called the
computers the library technical report often known as tr for short was released while not an official part of the standard it
computers it gives a number of extensions to the standard library which are expected to be included in the next version of
computers of c support for tr is growing in almost all currently maintained c compilers while the c language is royalty free
computers free the standard document itself is not freely available the name c this name is credited to rick mascitti mid and
computers and was first used in december earlier during the research period the developing language had been referred to as new c
computers c then c with classes in computer science c is still referred to as a superstructure of c the final name
computers name stems from c s operator which increments the value of a variable and a common naming convention of using to
computers to indicate an enhanced computer program according to stroustrup the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from c c
computers c was the name of an earlier unrelated language stroustrup addressed the origin of the name in the preface of later
computers later editions of his book the c language adding that c might be inferred from the appendix of george orwell s
computers s nineteen eighty four of the three segments of the fictional language newspeak the c vocabulary is the one dedicated to
computers to technical terms and jargon doubleplus is the superlative modifier for newspeak adjectives thus c might hold the meaning most extremely
computers extremely technical or jargonous in newspeak when rick mascitti was questioned informally in about the naming he indicated that it was
computers was given in a tongue in cheek spirit he never thought that it would become the formal name of the language
computers language a common joke of the name is that in c when you postfix the addition happens only after the operation
computers operation hence it should be c and not c future development c continues to evolve to meet future requirements one group
computers group in particular boost org works to make the most of c in its current form and advises the c standards
computers standards committee as to which features work well and which need improving current work indicates that c will capitalize on its
computers its multi paradigm nature more and more the work at boost for example is greatly expanding c s functional and metaprogramming
computers metaprogramming capabilities a new version of the c standard is currently being worked on entitled c x denoting the fact it
computers it is expected to be released before which will include a number of new features philosophy in the design and evolution
computers evolution of c bjarne stroustrup describes some rules that he uses for the design of c knowing the rules helps to
computers to understand why c is the way it is the ing is a summary of the rules much more detail can
computers can be found in the design and evolution of c c is designed to be a statically typed general purpose language
computers language that is as efficient and portable as c c is designed to directly and comprehensively support multiple styles procedural data
computers data abstraction object oriented programming and generic c is designed to give the programmer choice even if this makes it possible
computers possible for the programmer to choose incorrectly c is designed to be as compatible with c as possible therefore providing a
computers a smooth transition from c c avoids features that are platform specific or not general purpose c does not incur overhead
computers overhead for features that are not used c is designed to function without a sophisticated environment stanley b lippman describes various
computers various models in his in depth book inside the c object model for how compilers may convert c program statements into
computers into an in memory layout compiler vendors are free to implement the standard in their own manner lippman worked on implementing
computers implementing and maintaining cfront the original c implementation at bell labs standard library the c standard consists of two parts the
computers the core language and the c standard library the latter includes most of the standard template library and a slightly modified
computers modified version of the c standard library many c libraries exist which are not part of the standard and using external
computers external linkage libraries can even be in c the c standard library incorporates the c standard library with some small modifications
computers modifications to make it work better with the c language another large part of the c library is based on the
computers the standard template library stl this provides such useful tools as containers for example vectors and lists iterators generalized pointers to
computers to provide these containers with array like access and algorithms to perform operations such as searching and sorting furthermore multi maps
computers maps associative arrays and multi sets are provided all of which export compatible interfaces therefore it is possible using templates to
computers to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators as in c the features
computers features of the library are accessed by using the include directive to include a standard header c provides sixty nine standard
computers standard headers of which nineteen are deprecated using the standard library for example using std vector or std string instead of
computers of a c style array can help lead to safer and more scalable software the stl was originally a third party
computers party library from hp and later sgi before its incorporation into the c standard the standard does not refer to it
computers it as stl as it is merely a part of the standard library but many people still use that term to
computers to distinguish it from the rest of the library input output streams internationalization diagnostics the c library subset etc most c
computers c compilers provide an implementation of the c standard library including the stl compiler independent implementations of the stl such as
computers as stlport also exist other projects also produce various custom implementations of the c standard library and the stl with various
computers various design goals features introduced in c compared to the c language c introduced extra features including declarations as statements function
computers function like casts new delete bool reference types inline functions default arguments function overloading namespaces classes including all class related features
computers features such as inheritance member functions virtual functions abstract classes and constructors operator overloading templates the operator exception handling and runtime
computers runtime type identification contrary to popular belief c did not introduce the const keyword first const was formally added to c
computers c shortly before it was adopted by c c also performs more type checking than c in several cases see incompatibility
computers incompatibility with c below comments starting with two slashes were originally part of c s predecessor bcpl and were reintroduced in
computers in c several features of c were later adopted by c including declarations in for loops c style comments using the
computers the symbol and inline though the c definition of the inline keyword is not compatible with its c definition however c
computers c also introduced features that do not exist in c such as variadic macros and better handling of arrays as parameters
computers parameters some c compilers may implement some of these features as extensions but others are incompatible with existing c features a
computers a very common source of confusion is a subtle terminology issue because of its derivation from c in c the term
computers term object means memory area just like in c and not class instance which is what it means in most other
computers other object oriented languages for example in both c and c the statement int i defines an object of type int
computers int that is the memory area where the value of the variable i will be stored on assignment incompatibility with c
computers c for more details on this topic see compatibility of c and c c is often considered to be a superset
computers superset of c but this is not strictly true most c code can easily be made to compile correctly in c
computers c but there are a few differences that cause some valid c code to be invalid in c or to behave
computers behave differently in c perhaps the most commonly encountered difference is that c allows implicit conversion from void to other pointer
computers pointer types but c does not so the ing is valid c code int i malloc sizeof int implicit conversion from
computers from void to int but to make it work in both c and c one would need to use an explicit
computers explicit cast int i int malloc sizeof int another common portability issue is that c defines many new keywords such as
computers as new and class that may be used as identifiers e g variable names in a c program some incompatibilities have
computers have been removed by the latest c c standard which now supports c features such as comments and mixed declarations and
computers and code however c introduced a number of new features that conflict with c such as variable length arrays native complex
computers complex number types and compound literals so the languages may be diverging more than they are converging in order to intermix
computers intermix c and c code any c code which is to be called from used in c must be put in
computers in extern c c code sample code minimal program this is an example of a program which does nothing it begins
computers begins executing and immediately terminates it consists of one thing a main function the function main is the designated start of
computers of a c program in more complex c programs code can be executed before main begins for example the constructors of
computers of all global variables are run first there can be only one main function in a program notes on compiler issues
computers issues even though the latest c standard does not require a return in main some older compilers such as microsoft visual
computers visual c give warnings or errors for a main without a return statement and may not generate correct object code int
computers int main the c standard requires that main returns type int a program which uses any other return type for main
computers main is technically not standard c although many compilers do not enforce this strictly the standard also does not say what
computers what the return value of main actually means traditionally it is interpreted as the return value of the program itself the
computers the standard guarantees that returning zero or the macro exit success from main indicates successful termination unsuccessful termination can be indicated
computers indicated by returning the macro exit failure all other values are implementation defined this allows each operating system to define these
computers these values differently if as in this example execution reaches the end of main without encountering a return statement zero is
computers is returned implicitly only the main function has this implicit return statement in any other non void function reaching the end
computers end of the function without meeting a return statement is undefined behavior hello world program this is an example of a
computers a hello world program which uses the c standard library not the standard template library stl cout facility to display a
computers a message then terminates notes on include lt ostream gt an additional include lt ostream gt directive may be necessary with
computers with some obscure c implementations this is due to the fact that while the c iso standard requires that the standard
computers standard header iostream declares the object std cout to be an instance of the standard class ostream it does not demand
computers demand that iostream defines the class std ostream and the operations associated with it include lt iostream gt for std cout
computers cout using namespace std c programmers make use of using namespace lt name gt known as a using directive which imports
computers imports all symbols from the target namespace into the current namespace in this example using namespace std allows for unqualified access
computers access to all the standard library names so that std cout can be shortened to cout widespread use of the global
computers global using namespace directive is generally discouraged because importation of a large number of names may result in global namespace pollution
computers pollution this is especially true in header files which are included across many compilation units for this reason a more restricted
computers restricted using declaration may be used to import only the required names without importing the entire namespace in the example above
computers above the using namespace std may be replaced with using declarations as s using std cout using std endl for more
computers more examples see c examples language features operators main article operators in c and c preprocessor c is principally compiled in
computers in three phases preprocessing translation to object code and linking the two last phases are what is generally thought of as
computers as the compilation proper in the first phase preprocessing preprocessor directives apply lexical transformations to the source code which is then
computers then fed to the next compilation stage preprocessor directives and macros pre processing directives work by simple substitution of tokenized character
computers character sequences for other tokenized character sequences according to user defined rules they typically perform macro substitution inclusion of other files
computers files by opposition to higher order features such as inclusion of modules packages units components conditional compilation and or conditional inclusion
computers inclusion for instance define pi every time pi appears in the source code it will be replaced with another common example
computers example is include lt iostream gt which includes imports all symbols from the standard library header file iostream in addition to
computers to the most common directives mentioned above there are several additional preprocessor directives that control the flow of compilation conditionally include
computers include or exclude code blocks and control various other aspects of compilation also see preprocessor and c preprocessor templates templates are
computers are different from macros while both of these compile time language features can be used to produce conditional compilation templates are
computers are not restricted to lexical substitution templates have an awareness of the semantics and type system of their companion language as
computers as well as all compile time type definitions and can perform high level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation
computers evaluation of strictly type checked parameters macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria but cannot instantiate
computers instantiate new types recurse or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre compilation text substitution and text inclusion
computers inclusion exclusion in other words macros can control compilation flow based on pre defined symbols but cannot unlike templates independently instantiate
computers instantiate new symbols templates are a tool for static polymorphism see below and generic this can be found in the algorithm
computers algorithm header as std max in addition templates are a compile time mechanism in c which is turing complete meaning that
computers that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed in some form by a template metaprogram prior to runtime
computers runtime see also generic and template metaprogramming objects c introduces some object oriented oo features to c it offers classes which
computers which provide the four features commonly present in oo and some non oo languages abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism objects are
computers are set by classes which are basically like a set of attributes already defined and can be created at any time
computers time encapsulation encapsulation is the grouping together of data and functionality c implements encapsulation by allowing all members of a class
computers class to be declared as either public private or protected a public member of the class will be accessible to any
computers any function a private member will only be accessible to functions that are members of that class and to functions and
computers and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class friends a protected member will be accessible to members of classes that
computers that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends the oo principle is that all and
computers and only the functions that can access the internal representation of a type should be encapsulated within the type definition c
computers c supports this via member functions and friend functions but does not enforce it the programmer can declare parts or all
computers all of the representation of a type to be public and is also allowed to make public entities that are not
computers not part of the representation of the type because of this c supports not just oo programming but other weaker decomposition
computers decomposition paradigms like modular programming it is generally considered good practice to make all data private or protected and to make
computers make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class that hides implementation details
computers details inheritance inheritance allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types inheritance from a base class may be
computers be declared as public protected or private this access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public
computers public and protected members of the base class only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by inheritance the other
computers other two forms are much less frequently used if the access specifier is omitted inheritance is assumed to be private for
computers for a class base and public for a struct base base classes may be declared as virtual this is called virtual
computers virtual inheritance virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph avoiding some of
computers of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance multiple inheritance is a c feature sometimes considered controversial multiple inheritance allows a class
computers class to be derived from more than one base class this can result in a complicated graph of inheritance relationships for
computers for example a flying cat class can inherit from both cat and flying mammal some other languages such as c or
computers or java accomplish something similar although more limited by allowing inheritance of multiple interfaces while restricting the number of base classes
computers classes to one interfaces unlike classes provide only declarations of member functions no implementation or member data polymorphism see also polymorphism
computers polymorphism in object oriented programming polymorphism computer science enables one common interface for many implementations and for objects to act different
computers different under different circumstances c supports several kinds of static compile time and dynamic run time polymorphism compile time polymorphism does
computers does not allow for certain run time decisions while run time polymorphism typically incurs a performance penalty static polymorphism function overloading
computers overloading function overloading allows programs to declare multiple functions with the same name the functions are distinguished by the number and
computers and or types of their formal parameters thus the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context
computers context in which it is used the type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions operator overloading
computers overloading similarly operator overloading allows programs to define certain operators such as lt or amp to result in a function call
computers call that depends on the types of the operands they are used on class and function templates templates in c provide
computers provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic polymorphic code in particular through the curiously recurring template pattern it s possible to
computers to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual methods a dynamic polymorphism technique described
computers described below since c templates are type aware and turing complete they can also be used to let the compiler resolve
computers resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through template metaprogramming dynamic polymorphism polymorphism through inheritance variable pointers and references of a
computers a base class type in c can refer to objects of any derived classes of that type in addition to objects
computers objects exactly matching the variable type this allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing
computers differing types because assignment of values to variables usually occurs at run time this is necessarily a run time phenomenon c
computers c also provides a dynamic cast operator which allows the program to safely attempt conversion of an object into an object
computers object of a more specific object type as opposed to conversion to a more general type which is always allowed this
computers this feature relies on run time type information rtti objects known to be of a certain specific type can also be
computers be cast to that type with static cast a purely compile time construct which is faster and does not require rtti
computers rtti virtual member functions through virtual member functions different objects that share a common base class may all support an operation
computers operation in different ways the member functions implemented by the derived class are said to override the same member functions of
computers of the base class in contrast with function overloading the parameters for a given member function are always exactly the same
computers same in number and type only the type of the object for which this method is called varies in addition to
computers to standard member functions operator overloads and destructors can also be virtual by virtue of inherited objects being polymorphic it may
computers may not be possible for the compiler to determine the type of the object at compile time the decision is therefore
computers therefore put off until runtime and is called dynamic dispatch in this way the most specific implementation of the function is
computers is called according to the actual run time type of the object in c this is commonly done using virtual function
computers function tables this may sometimes be bypassed by prepending a fully qualified class name before the function call but calls to
computers to virtual functions are in general always resolved at run time this example program makes use of virtual functions polymorphism and
computers and inheritance to derive new more specific objects from a base class in this case the base class is a bird
computers bird and the more specific swan is made parsing and processing c source code it is relatively difficult to write a
computers a good c parser with classic parsing algorithms such as lalr see this is partly because the c grammar is not
computers not lalr because of this there are very few tools for analyzing or performing non trivial transformations e g refactoring of
computers of existing code one way to handle this difficulty is to choose a different syntax such as significantly prettier and easier
computers easier c syntax which is lalr parseable parsing in the literal sense of producing a syntax tree is not the most
computers most difficult problem in building a c processing tool such tools must also have the same understanding of the meaning of
computers of the identifiers in the program as a compiler might have practical systems for processing c must then not only parse
computers parse the source text but be able to resolve for each identifier precisely which identifier definition applies e g correctly handle
computers handle c s complex scoping rules but must also be able to determine the type of each identifer and expression finally
computers finally a practical c processing tool must be able to handle the variety of c dialects used in practice gnu microsoft
computers microsoft but also implement appropriate analyzers source code transformers and regenerate source text combining advanced parsing algorithms such as glr with
computers with symbol table construction and program transformation machinery can enable the construction of arbitrary c tools problems and controversies c has
computers has been the subject of debate traditionally c compilers have had a range of problems the c standard does not cover
computers cover implementation of name mangling exception handling and other implementation specific features making object code produced by different compilers incompatible there
computers there are however third party standards for particular machines or operating systems which attempt to standardize compilers on those platforms for
computers for example c abi some compilers adopt a secondary standard for these items for many years different c compilers implemented the
computers the c language to different levels of compliance to the standard and their implementations varied widely in some areas such as
computers as partial template specialization recent releases of most popular c compilers support almost all of the c standard one particular point
computers point of contention is the export keyword intended to allow template definitions to be separated from their declarations the first compiler
computers compiler to implement export was comeau c in early years after the release of the standard in the beta compiler of
computers of borland c builder x was also released with export both of these compilers are based on the edg c front
computers front end it should also be noted that many c books provide example code for implementing the keyword export for example
computers example beginning ansi c by ivor horton which will not compile but there is no reference to the problem with the
computers the keyword export mentioned other compilers such as gcc do not support it at all herb sutter secretary of the c
computers c standards committee recommended that export be removed from future versions of the c standard but finally the decision was made
computers made to leave it in the c standard modern critics of the language raise several points first since c is based
computers based on and largely compatible with c it inherits most of the criticisms levelled at that language taken as a whole
computers whole c has a large feature set including all of c plus a large set of its own additions in part
computers part leading to criticisms of being a bloated and complicated language especially for embedded systems due to features such as exceptions
computers exceptions and rtti which add to code size however every compiler allows the developer to disable exceptions if desired bjarne stroustrup
computers stroustrup also points out that resultant executables don t support these claims of bloat i have even seen the c version
computers version of the hello world program smaller than the c version the embedded c standard was specified to deal with part
computers part of this but it received criticism for leaving out useful parts of the language that incur no runtime penalty because
computers because of its large featureset it can be quite difficult to fully master c leading to programmers often bringing unnecessarily advanced
computers advanced or complicated solutions to simple problems while c is more complex than some other programming languages bjarne stroustrup points out
computers out that the programming world is far more complex today than it was years ago and modern programming languages reflect that
computers that the iso standard of the c language is about pages excluding library for comparison the c programming language s is
computers is about pages even though it was designed more than years prior and doesn t consider object oriented programming furthermore c
computers c s ecma language definition document is about pages c is also sometimes compared unfavorably with single paradigm object oriented languages
computers languages such as java on the basis that it allows programmers to mix and match object oriented and procedural programming rather
computers rather than strictly enforcing a single paradigm this is part of a wider debate on the relative merits of the two

computers walks through the process of creating a new swing component of medium complexity and highlights the important points steps and pitfalls
computers pitfalls along the way basic building blocks the swing architecture overview provides an excellent high level overview of the architectural decisions
computers decisions that were made during the development of swing although it will take slightly more work to create a new component
computers component ing the rules outlined in this article the resulting code will be much easier to maintain since it will adhere
computers adhere to the core swing principles without reinventing the wheel at the first look you might be tempted to throw everything
computers everything together in one single class that will provide the external api the model handling state and notifications event handling layout

computers make your component codebase much easier to maintain and extend in the long run the main building blocks of all core

computers creating a custom component that is based on the new view slider from microsoft windows vista os explorer see figure while
computers while this component looks very much like a slider embedded in a pop up menu it has new features that are
computers are not available on a regular jslider first it has control points that have associated icons and labels in addition while
computers while some ranges are contiguous like small icons medium icons and allow continuous resizing of the file icons other ranges are
computers are discrete like tiles details when the value is in one of these ranges the slider thumb can be only at
computers at control points and not inside the range figure view slider in microsoft windows vista os the component class ui delegate
computers delegate plumbing the first class for a custom component is the component api itself the api should be as simple as
computers as possible and delegate most of the business logic to the model see the next section in addition to the api
computers api you should add the boilerplate code for setting the proper ui delegate described in detail in the enhancing swing applications

computers services combine axis the next generation web services api of apache axis with spring to expose pojo based domain tier applications
computers applications as both rest and soap based web services by ramanujam a rao february he growing acceptance of loosely coupled services
computers services in enterprise application development and the continuing buzz around service oriented architecture soa has created substantial momentum in enterprises for
computers for consumable services which can be invoked and utilized remotely the significance and value of soap based web services as a
computers a medium for achieving a services driven architecture have also gained wide acceptance during the past few years web services can
computers can be created in several ways but enterprises typically have a substantial investment in existing applications that house business functions therefore
computers therefore they need a design that allows for their domain functions to be easily efficiently and securely exposed as web services
computers services this article explains how to expose existing pojo driven j ee applications as web services using axis while still providing
computers providing enough room for scalability it describes leveraging spring which already serves as the underlying dependency injection container for many j
computers j ee applications today to further facilitate the creation and control of these services finally it discusses deployment strategies for axis
computers axis enterprise web services and lists the specific concerns with certain application servers such as ibm websphere the application a typical
computers typical j ee application is usually tiered with distinct presentation and business domain tiers either custom factories controllers or frameworks such
computers such as spring are used to tie all the components together take for example an application with a simple web tier
computers tier and a domain tier that encapsulates the business logic for the sake of simplicity the example application in this article
computers article combines the web tier and the domain in the same project structure even though in reality these are distinct figure
computers figure shows the structure of the sample application accountweb figure existing application structure the application has a domain function called accountmanager
computers accountmanager which serves the front end accountmanager is implemented as accountmanagerimpl and uses the domain object account again for convenience it
computers it has hard coded logic and returns values based on variable pre determined input a typical application would have a full
computers full fledged domain business tier with data access and integration components providing data as its domain logic interface shows accountmanager has
computers has two methods public interface accountmanager public account getaccount string accountid public void setstatus string accountid boolean status the remainder of
computers of the article demonstrates how to expose the accountmanager function and both of its methods as externally consumable web services using
computers using axis and spring creating web services using axis a web service consists of provider side code called skeletons and consumer
computers consumer side segments called stubs stubs and skeletons are used for marshalling and unmarshalling requests hence the first step here is
computers is creating producer side components for your service you can create a web service using a bottom up or top down
computers down approach in a bottom up approach you create java classes and then generate a service descriptor wsdl from it with
computers with a top down approach you create a wsdl and generate java classes from it since you already have your business
computers business function in the form of java classes in the example application you will use the bottom up approach axis supports
computers supports both synchronous and asynchronous services this example utilizes only synchronous services the ing steps summarize the procedure for creating a
computers a web service from existing domain classes using axis and spring generate wsdl from the current implementation generate producer side skeletons
computers skeletons and client side stubs from the wsdl configure the spring wiring and edit the skeleton implementation to hook to the
computers the existing classes once the services are created and configured you will need to do the ing deploy the service test
computers test it with a client before going any further you need to download axis binaries and install them in the library
computers library directory of the application in the classpath with certain application servers such as websphere and weblogic these libraries can cause
computers cause conflicts with the default libraries provided by the server later sections on deployment will delve into this in a bit
computers bit more detail for now it will suffice to know that you can resolve these conflicts by manipulating the classloaders and
computers and other classpath policies the accompanying source code provides all the examples page of download the source code next page generating

computers expression survived for some time at least in paper documentation and usage m now stood for meta more so than for

computers into code and code into data this makes it easy to experiment with variants and extensions of the language whereas lisp
computers lisp started as kind of a functional programming language it could and did easily absorb imperative programming structured programming object oriented
computers oriented programming graphical user interfaces pattern matching logic distributed dynamic web applications etc as soon as someone somewhere invented any feasible
computers feasible paradigm said paradigm could easily be imported into lisp whereas a non lisper inventor of some idea would maybe with
computers with a lot of effort after many years build a full fledged language from scratch around his one paradigm lispers could
computers could with comparatively little incremental effort support the same paradigm as the extension of a one environment that also supported all
computers all the previously invented paradigms and that would also support all the future paradigms whenever these would be invented and of
computers of course while experimenting lispers are not limited to an all or nothing approach of language selection but can explore all
computers all kinds of language features and ways to combine them and get an actual running language implementation for each combination for
computers for instance while experimenting with the scheme dialect of lisp steele and sussman were reportedly writing as many as ten interpreters
computers interpreters a week by contrast non lispers may require weeks s or years between each actually tested iteration of their language
computers language design process this allows lisp to benefit from a language design experience beyond anything that has ever been tried with
computers with any other programming language lisp was the only intrinsically programmable programming language now just any universal programming language can be
computers be encoded so that code can be included and manipulated as data by programs in the same language and indeed most
computers most serious programming languages end up being implemented by a compiler in same language after a phase of bootstrap from a
computers a different metalanguage using the very same technique used with lisp between and in any case any language implementation supposes that
computers that a mechanism is provided by which programs can be practically encoded as data if only as a data stream from
computers from user input to be directly interpreted or compiled without intermediate representation thus any language is at least in theory and
computers and at least in some contorted practical way fit for metaprogramming however lisp still possesses quite an edge in this regard
computers regard which is intimately tied to its very distinctive characteristic the encoding of code as nested lists of symbols and other
computers other data firstly this encoding of code as data is well defined as part of the language itself this means that
computers that there is a common standard representation that serves as the basis for development of metaprograms by anyone by contrast in
computers in other languages every would be metaprogrammer has to start from scratch and sharing his metacode with other people will be
computers be hampered because encoding is implementation dependent subject to changes restricted by intellectual property barriers etc this restrains considerably the potential
computers potential for human collaboration about metaprograms secondly the lisp encoding of code as nested lists is very simple and powerful the
computers the choice of a single universal and versatile data structure means that it is very easy to write metaprograms both from
computers from lisp and to lisp as said alan perlis it is better to have functions operate on one data structure than
computers than functions on data structures the overhead for writing metaprograms in lisp is thus very low as compared to what you
computers you have in about any other language there is opportunity for writing code that is both shorter and more widely applicable
computers applicable than in other languages less expensive and more valuable thirdly the natural mapping between the nested list structure of code
computers code as data and the semantics of said code also contribute to making metaprogramming simple the recursive evaluation model where all
computers all expressions yield values makes it much simpler to manipulate programs than the common dual statements vs expressions model found in
computers in most other languages more generally the lisp grammar has two non terminals pairs and atoms where other languages commonly have
computers have a lot of non terminals that lead to a combinatorial explosion for metaprograms the ability to locally define lexical dynamic
computers dynamic and syntactic bindings as well as higher order functions method combinations and many other features also allow for local code
computers code transformations to be much more expressive than they could possibly be in other languages where the same effects would require
computers require global program rewrite lisp code can thus be factored in much nicer ways than code in other languages fourthly because
computers because lisp code can be compiled efficiently and dynamically it is not only easy but also efficient to use lisp as
computers as the target for metaprograms in other languages people have to use slow interpreters or to target special purpose virtual machines
computers machines when generating code dynamically because dynamic production linkage and execution of code is so difficult interestingly technical difficulties with these
computers these languages can often be overcome at the price of bulk slowness unsafety and various limitations but intellectual property restrictions on
computers on the availability and use of the compiler and linker make these techniques impossible to use on the mainstream of computers
computers computers running proprietary systems with mainstream languages quasiquotation allows one to easily write templates of data including most particularly code representation
computers representation where part of the structure is fixed whereas other parts are computed the syntax is almost the same as for
computers for quoted data except for unquotes at places where the structure is not fixed and computation is to happen quasiquotes can
computers can be nested which allows for meta meta programs or meta n programs interestingly quasiquotation is a concept independent from the
computers the actual representation of programs it helps abstract away from the fact that programs be encoded as lists or otherwise it
computers it gets even better when it can be used for matching code as well as for generating code lists are still
computers still useful though and so are straight quotes in combination with quasiquotes lists allow to handle the variable part of program
computers program patterns and quotes are instrumental in distinguishing levels of nested unquotation thus it is unclear whether use of quasiquotation in
computers in other languages matches the utility of quasiquotation in lisp a notable exception is slate which with tagged quasiquotation can do
computers do unquotation in a clearer and more powerful way than is possible in straight lisp though lisp can be extended to
computers to match this feature also interestingly the discovery of quasiquotation and the power unleashed by nesting it and combining it with
computers with quote is tied to the existence of quote and hence to the specifically lispy tradition of a separate data syntax
computers syntax last but not least the lisp language also includes a lot of reflective infrastructure from boundp to get setf expander
computers expander to the clos mop that allows one to write language extensions that take advantage of each other instead of being
computers being mutually incompatible as happens in so many other languages in any mainstream language language extension implies having mutually incompatible new
computers new compilers for each set of new features by contrast language extension in lisp is a matter of using components that
computers that most of the time interoperate out of the box you may have to ensure that globally rewriting metaprograms are run
computers run in the right order but this is intrinsic to the problem of combining such metaprograms and the infrastructure of lisp
computers lisp makes such problems far less frequent than in other languages the worst you usually have to do is to ensure
computers ensure that symbols are interned in the right package in conclusion unlike most other languages lisp is not an arbitrary design
computers design based on the whims of some author but it is a discovery produced by a long evolution and a deep
computers deep tradition it has seen several revolutions transition from m expression to s expression from evalquote to eval or from dynamic
computers dynamic binding to static binding introduction of data structures of object oriented programming and of a meta object protocol the invention
computers invention and latter standardization of many many individual features many dialects of lisp also introduce their own revolutions such as continuations
computers continuations and single name space in scheme the graphical user interface and dreaded dwim features in interlisp etc if anything remains
computers remains among all these revolutions and variants it is the ability to evolve lisp is a language fit for evolution not
computers not just by a small group of wizards who control the language implementation but by every single programmer who uses the
computers the language and this wasn t a conscious intended part of the original design this was the great discovery of lisp
computers lisp if this article made you want to start using lisp i can recommend the quick lisp guide to starting with
computers with common lisp if you want to know why metaprogramming matters see my article metaprogramming and free availability of sources in
computers in a next article i will write about how some other languages allow for evolution in different ways what they still
computers still have to learn from the lisp tradition what the lisp tradition has to learn from them what makes it difficult
computers difficult for either mainstream languages or lisp languages a a a list of three elements a list of no elements the
computers the empty list nil a list of no elements the empty list a a list of one element the string a
computers a a a list of two elements a and the empty list a nil equivalent to the previous a b c
computers c a list of one element which is a list of three elements and then the aha moment happens i finally
computers finally get lisp it s just a string representation of the abstract syntax tree for any language i could embed a
computers a lisp interpreter in the query parser i could use lisp macros to perform optimizations on the query there s a
computers a jjtree grammar for python in the jython package i could parse python into lisp programs i m onto a really
computers really big concept possibly the next big thing the grand unification of all scripting languages now i have to move back
computers back to xemacs from netbeans all i need to do is increase the output by and the city will be mine
computers mine if only i had more power at mit lisp plays a foundational role in the curriculum for all programmers entrepreneurs
computers entrepreneurs like paul graham used lisp s incredible productivity as the jet fuel for successful startups but to the chagrin of
computers of its lispers lisp never made it into the mainstream as a java programmer if you spend some time with lisp
computers lisp a notice that lisp capitalizes the a lisp assumes that you want to use a as a symbol because you
computers you have not enclosed it in quotes i ll discuss assignments but i first need to cover lists to do so
computers so a lisp list is simply a sequence of atoms enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces try to type a
computers a list such as the one in listing it doesn t work unless you precede the list with a listing typing
computers typing a simple list gt gt first rest rest gt cons cons nil gt cons cons cons nil gt cons first
computers first these examples might not get you excited but the principle of building a clean and beautiful language on such simple
computers simple primitives is intoxicating to some programmers these simple list building instructions form the foundation of recursions higher order functions and
computers and even higher order abstractions like closures and continuations it s time to move up to higher abstractions back to top
computers top building functions lisp function declarations are you guessed it lists listing which builds a function returning a list s second
computers second element shows the form of function declarations listing building the second function defun my second lst first rest lst defun
computers defun is the function that defines custom functions the first argument is the function name the second the argument list and
computers and the third is the code you wish to execute you can see that all lisp code is expressed as lists
computers lists this flexibility and power let you manipulate your application as well as you can manipulate any other data you ll
computers ll later see some examples that blur the distinction between code and data lisp also handles conditional constructs such as the
computers the if statement the form is if condition statement then statement else statement listing shows a simple my max function that
computers that computes the maximum of two input variables listing computing the max of two integers defun my max x y if
computers if gt x y x y racket scheme haskell common lisp let me review what you ve seen so far lisp
computers lisp uses lists and atoms to represent both data and programs evaluating a list treats the first element as a list
computers list function and the other elements as function arguments lisp conditional statements use true false expressions in conjunction with code back
computers back to top recursion lisp provides coding structures for iteration but recursion is a far more popular way to navigate lists
computers lists the combination of first and rest works well with recursion the total function in listing shows how it works listing
computers listing using recursion to compute the total of a lists for example the lambda expression in listing computes the sum of
computers of two integers listing lambda expressions gt setf total lambda a b a b lambda a b a b gt total
computers total lambda a b a b gt apply total racket scheme haskell common lisp combinator in haskell it won t typecheck
computers typecheck so there s no way to get fix e u i u e to expand haskell corresponds to the strongly
computers strongly typed lambda calculus and the only fixpoints are those provided by the language itself either in tom s y f
computers f f y f or in data definitions i ve heard you can build a y combinator of sorts using the
computers the latter but never actually tried it posted by emk am eric i m the same way about puzzles the y
computers y combinator was a mildly interesting toy to me sort of like a rubik s cube or a crossword puzzle i
computers i could play with it for a few minutes but it couldn t really hold my attention what really put me
computers me over the top about learning it was when i started writing a parser combinator library if you write those combinator
computers combinator as recursive functions then left recursion will make the parser loop and i found that really inelegant but if you
computers you write a customized recursion combinator your recursive parser can check to ensure you re making progress through the stream and
computers and abort if you start to loop writing such a combinator requires understanding how the y combinator works and that gave
computers gave me the energy to really dig into it my learning methodology is to read very broadly but shallowly to get
computers get a big store of ideas i ve heard about as contrasted with ideas i really understand then when i write
computers write some code that seems inelegant to me i ll try and pattern match against the things i ve read about
computers about and rummage for some applicable sounding ideas then i ll study them in depth to figure out how to write
computers write something more general i think this is a less common style among hacker types who generally find intrinsic excitement in
computers in puzzles for example this year s icfp contest was an enormous home run hit but it was one that left
computers left me a little cold even though the guys who did it put in an awesome amount of effort to make
computers make it cool posted by neel krishnaswami am ah i didn t realize the part of the challenge was to limit
computers limit myself to lambda calculus features i m still going to use ruby s splat operator however alright then let s
computers s work it through here s my original ruby definition def y f lambda args f y f args end to
computers to get rid of the recursive call y f let s replace it with a variable yf whose value we ll
computers ll say is magically equivalent to the result of the recursive call racket scheme haskell common lisp ruby on rails ruby
computers ruby are good candidates used ruby but certainly has its benefits and exposure to both balances out my understanding i hope
computers hope that if you were curious about functional before this was a helpful read if you re a functional programmer and
computers and i got something wrong please let me know i m still learning for instance i now better understand how recursive
computers recursive processes differ from linear recursive processes responses to functional in javascript and ruby rspec ruby rails gem gemfile sinatra the

computers above rspec ruby rails gem gemfile sinatra railsconf ruby programmers mongrel ruby ruby on rails mongrel ruby on rails with rubygems
computers rubygems some rails developers suggest that it s possible to learn and use rails without learning the ruby basics first but
computers but as far as i m concerned it s extremely beneficial to know even a little ruby before diving into the
computers the guts of rails in fact if you take the time to learn the ruby basics first new object of class
computers class array using the array new construct you can also use a shortcut approach which is to enclose the objects you
computers you want to place inside the array in square brackets class methods and instance methods provided by the array class is
computers is available via the ruby reference documentation which you can access by entering the ri command into the terminal window for
computers for your operating system not the ruby shell ed by the class name you d like to look up ri array
computers array oh and ri stands for ruby interactive in case you re wondering don t confuse it with irb hashes a
computers a hash is another kind of data storage container hashes are similar conceptually to dictionaries they map one object the key
computers key for example a word to another object the value for example a word s definition in a one to one
computers one relationship new hash es can be created either by instantiating a new object of class hash using the hash new
computers new construct or by using the curly brace shortcut shown below when we define a hash we must specify each entry

computers programming language it was designed and developed in the mid s by yukihiro matz matsumoto in japan according to its creator
computers creator ruby was influenced by perl smalltalk eiffel ada and lisp it supports multiple programming paradigms including functional object oriented and
computers and imperative it also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management matsumoto has said that ruby is designed for
computers for programmer productivity and fun following the principles of good user interface design at a google tech talk in matsumoto further
computers further stated i hope to see ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive and to enjoy programming and
computers and to be happy that is the primary purpose of ruby language he stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human
computers human rather than computer ruby is object oriented every value is an object including classes and instances of types that many
computers many other languages designate as primitives such as integers booleans and null variables always hold references to objects every function is
computers is a method and methods are always called on an object methods defined at the top level scope become members of
computers of the object class since this class is an ancestor of every other class such methods can be called on any
computers any object they are also visible in all scopes effectively serving as global procedures ruby supports inheritance with dynamic dispatch mixins
computers mixins and singleton methods belonging to and defined for a single instance rather than being defined on the class though ruby
computers ruby does not support multiple inheritance classes can import modules as mixins ruby has been described as a multi paradigm programming
computers programming language it allows procedural programming defining functions variables outside classes makes them part of the root self object with object
computers object orientation everything is an object or functional programming it has anonymous functions closures and continuations statements all have values and

computers lisp scheme c program programming computer programming often shortened to programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of
computers of a computing problem to executable programs it involves activities such as analysis understanding and generically solving such problems resulting in
computers in an algorithm verification of requirements of the algorithm including its correctness and its resource consumption implementation commonly referred to as
computers as coding of the algorithm in a target programming language testing debugging and maintaining the source code implementation of the build
computers build system and management of derived artefacts such as machine code of computer programs the algorithm is often only represented in
computers in human parsable form and reasoned about using logic source code is in one or more programming languages such as c
computers c c c java python smalltalk javascript etc the purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will
computers will automate performing a specific task or solve a given problem the process of programming thus often requires expertise in many
computers many different subjects including knowledge of the application domain specialized algorithms and formal logic within software engineering programming the implementation is
computers is regarded as one phase in a software development process there is an on going debate on the extent to which
computers which the writing of programs is an art form a craft or an engineering discipline in general good programming is considered
computers considered to be the measured application of all three with the goal of producing an efficient and evolvable software solution the
computers the criteria for efficient and evolvable vary considerably the discipline differs from many other technical professions in that programmers in general
computers general do not need to be licensed or pass any standardized or governmentally regulated certification tests in order to call themselves
computers themselves programmers or even software engineers because the discipline covers many areas which may or may not include critical applications it
computers it is debatable whether licensing is required for the profession as a whole in most cases the discipline is self governed
computers governed by the entities which require the programming and sometimes very strict environments are defined e g united states air force
computers force use of adacore and security clearance however representing oneself as a professional software engineer without a license from an accredited
computers accredited institution is illegal in many parts of the world another on going debate is the extent to which the programming
computers programming language used in writing computer programs affects the form that the final program citation needed this debate is analogous to
computers to that surrounding the sapir whorf hypothesis in linguistics and cognitive science which the first step in most formal software development
computers development processes is requirements analysis ed by testing to determine value modeling implementation and failure elimination debugging there exist a lot
computers lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks one approach popular for requirements analysis is use case analysis many programmers
computers programmers use forms of agile software development where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short

economics how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work consistent with this a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and
economics and macroeconomics microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy including individual agents such as households and firms or
economics or as buyers and sellers and markets and their interactions macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it including unemployment
economics unemployment inflation economic growth and monetary and fiscal policy other broad distinctions include those between positive economics describing what is and
economics and normative economics advocating what ought to be between economic theory and applied economics between rational and behavioral economics and between
economics between mainstream economics more orthodox and dealing with the rationality individualism equilibrium nexus and heterodox economics more radical and dealing with
economics with the institutions history social structure nexus economic analysis may be applied throughout society as in business finance health care and
economics and government but also to such diverse subjects as crime education the family law politics religion social institutions war and science
economics science at the turn of the st century the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as
economics as economic imperialism an increasing number of economists have called for increased emphasis on environmental sustainability this area of research is

economics of economics some of the differences may reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists scottish philosopher adam
economics adam smith defined what was then called political economy as an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of
economics of nations in particular as a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator with the twofold objectives of providing
economics providing a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people and to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the

economics production distribution and consumption of wealth on the satirical side thomas carlyle coined the dismal science as an epithet for classical
economics classical economics in this context commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of malthus john stuart mill defines the subject in a
economics a social context as the science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the
economics the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the
economics the pursuit of any other object alfred marshall provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook principles of economics that
economics that extends analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level economics is a study of man in the
economics the ordinary business of life it enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it thus it is on
economics on the one side the study of wealth and on the other and more important side a part of the study
economics study of man lionel robbins developed implications of what has been termed p erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of
economics of the subject economics is a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have
economics have alternative uses robbins describes the definition as not classificatory in pick ing out certain kinds of behaviour but rather analytical
economics analytical in focus ing attention on a particular aspect of behaviour the form imposed by the influence of scarcity some subsequent
economics subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets from the
economics the s however such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behavior and rational choice modeling expanded the domain of
economics of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields there are other criticisms as well such as in scarcity not
economics not accounting for the macroeconomics of high unemployment gary becker a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas describes
economics describes the approach he favors as combin ing the assumptions of maximizing behavior stable preferences and market equilibrium used relentlessly and
economics and un inchingly one commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great
economics great specificity as to the choice process and the type of social interaction that such analysis involves the same source reviews
economics reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect
economics affect the subject matter that the texts treat among economists more generally it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect
economics reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving or should evolve microeconomics main article microeconomics economic development economic
economics economic development refers to not only increase in the output and growth of an economy but includes the various changes in
economics in the institutional arrangements through which output is generated economic development refers to the achievement of a new equilibrium over the
economics the previously attained equilibrium it is a micro economic concept with direct relation to economic growth as growth can be achieved
economics achieved with or without development but economic development always results in growth markets a vegetable vendor in a marketplace economists study
economics study trade production and consumption decisions such as those that occur in a traditional marketplace two men sit at computer monitors
economics monitors with financial information in virtual markets buyer and seller are not present and trade via intermediates and electronic information pictured
economics pictured s o paulo stock exchange microeconomics is the study of economics analysing individual players of a market and the structure
economics structure of such markets it deals with as its irreducible base unit private public and domestic players microeconomics studies how these
economics these players interact with each other through individual markets assuming that there is a scarcity of tradable units and government regulation
economics regulation a market might deal with a product such as apples aluminium and mobile phones or with services of a factor
economics factor of production brick laying book printing food packaging microeconomics theory considers the aggregates the sum of of quantity demanded by
economics by buyers and quantity supplied by sellers studying each possible price per unit i e supply and demand it studies the
economics the complex interaction between market players both through buying and selling theory holds that markets may reach equilibrium between quantity demanded
economics demanded and quantity supplied supply and demand over time microeconomics also examines various market structures perfect competition describes a market structure
economics structure such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product
economics product another way of putting this is to say a perfectly competitive market exists when every participant is a price taker
economics taker and no participant influences the price of the product it buys or sells imperfect competition refers to market structures where
economics where the conditions of perfect competition do not exist forms of imperfect competition include monopoly in which there is only one
economics one seller of a good duopoly in which there are only two sellers of a good oligopoly in which there are
economics are few sellers of a good monopolistic competition in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods monopsony in which
economics which there is only one buyer of a good and oligopsony in which there are few buyers of a good unlike
economics unlike perfect competition imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be
economics be price makers which means that by holding a disproportionately high share of market power they can influence the prices of
economics of their products microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed
economics analysed does not affect other markets this method of analysis is known as partial equilibrium analysis supply and demand this method
economics method aggregates the sum of all activity in only one market general equilibrium theory studies various markets and their behaviour it
economics it aggregates the sum of all activity across all markets this method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading
economics leading towards equilibrium production cost and efficiency main articles production theory basics opportunity cost economic efficiency and production possibility frontier in
economics in microeconomics production is the conversion of inputs into outputs it is an economic process that uses inputs to create a
economics a commodity for exchange or direct use production is a flow and thus a rate of output per period of time
economics time distinctions include such production alternatives as for consumption food haircuts etc vs investment goods new tractors buildings roads etc public
economics public goods national defense small pox vaccinations etc or private goods new computers bananas etc and guns vs butter opportunity cost
economics cost refers to the economic cost of production the value of the next best opportunity foregone choices must be made between
economics between desirable yet mutually exclusive actions it has been described as expressing the basic relationship between scarcity and choice the opportunity
economics opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently such that the cost is
economics is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it opportunity costs are not restricted
economics restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the real cost of output forgone leisure or anything else
economics else that provides the alternative benefit utility inputs used in the production process include such primary factors of production as labour
economics labour services capital durable produced goods used in production such as an existing factory and land including natural resources other inputs
economics inputs may include intermediate goods used in production of final goods such as the steel in a new car economic efficiency
economics efficiency describes how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available technology efficiency is improved
economics improved if more output is generated without changing inputs or in other words the amount of waste is reduced a widely
economics widely accepted general standard is pareto efficiency which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making
economics making someone else worse off an example ppf with illustrative points marked the production possibility frontier ppf is an expository figure
economics figure for representing scarcity cost and efficiency in the simplest case an economy can produce just two goods say guns and
economics and butter the ppf is a table or graph as at the right showing the different quantity combinations of the two
economics two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs which limit feasible total output each point on the curve
economics curve shows potential total output for the economy which is the maximum feasible output of one good given a feasible output
economics output quantity of the other good scarcity is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate
economics aggregate to consume beyond the ppf such as at x and by the negative slope of the curve if production of
economics of one good increases along the curve production of the other good decreases an inverse relationship this is because increasing output
economics output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good decreasing the latter the slope of
economics of the curve at a point on it gives the trade off between the two goods it measures what an additional
economics additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good an example of a real opportunity cost thus
economics thus if one more gun costs units of butter the opportunity cost of one gun is butter along the ppf scarcity
economics scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good still in
economics in a market economy movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be
economics be worth the cost to the agents by construction each point on the curve shows productive efficiency in maximizing output for
economics for given total inputs a point inside the curve as at a is feasible but represents production inefficiency wasteful use of
economics of inputs in that output of one or both goods could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point
economics point on the curve examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business cycle recession or economic organization of
economics of a country that discourages full use of resources being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency also
economics also called pareto efficiency if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points much applied
economics applied economics in public policy is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved recognizing the reality
economics reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described
economics described as the essence of economics where the subject makes its unique contribution specialization main articles division of labour comparative advantage
economics advantage and gains from trade specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and empirical considerations different individuals or
economics or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production say from differences in stocks of human capital per worker or
economics or capital labour ratios according to theory this may give a comparative advantage in production of goods that make more intensive
economics intensive use of the relatively more abundant thus relatively cheaper input even if one region has an absolute advantage as to
economics to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output it may still specialize in the output in
economics in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but
economics but has a comparative advantage in producing something else it has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among
economics among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs including high income countries this has led
economics led to investigation of economies of scale and agglomeration to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines to the overall
economics overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions the general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals farms manufacturers service
economics service providers and economies among each of these production systems there may be a corresponding division of labour with different work
economics work groups specializing or correspondingly different types of capital equipment and differentiated land uses an example that combines features above is
economics is a country that specializes in the production of high tech knowledge products as developed countries do and trades with developing
economics developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful resulting in different in opportunity costs of
economics of production more total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its
economics its own high tech and low tech products theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs
economics outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage so that relatively low cost inputs go to
economics to producing low cost outputs in the process aggregate output may increase as a by product or by design such specialization
economics specialization of production creates opportunities for gains from trade whereby resource owners benefit from trade in the sale of one type
economics type of output for other more highly valued goods a measure of gains from trade is the increased income levels that
economics that trade may facilitate supply and demand main article supply and demand a graph depicting quantity on the x axis and
economics and price on the y axis the supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance
economics balance between product availability and demand the graph depicts an increase that is right shift in demand from d to d
economics d along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve
economics curve s prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a
economics a market economy the theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced
economics produced and consumed in microeconomics it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition which includes the
economics the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price setting power for a given market of a commodity
economics commodity demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of
economics of the good demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded as in the
economics the figure demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good given income prices tastes
economics tastes etc a term for this is constrained utility maximization with income and wealth as the constraints on demand here utility
economics utility refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred the
economics the law of demand states that in general price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related that is
economics is the higher the price of a product the less of it people would be prepared to buy of it other
economics other things unchanged as the price of a commodity falls consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods the substitution
economics substitution effect in addition purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy the income effect other factors can change
economics change demand for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the
economics the origin as in the figure all determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply supply is the
economics the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price it may be represented
economics represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied producers for example business firms are hypothesized to be profit
economics profit maximizers meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit
economics profit supply is typically represented as a directly proportional relation between price and quantity supplied other things unchanged that is the
economics the higher the price at which the good can be sold the more of it producers will supply as in the
economics the figure the higher price makes it profitable to increase production just as on the demand side the position of the
economics the supply can shift say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement the law
economics law of supply states that in general a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in
economics in price leads to a contraction in supply here as well the determinants of supply such as price of substitutes cost
economics cost of production technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time
economics time period of evaluation of supply market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded the intersection of the supply and
economics and demand curves in the figure above at a price below equilibrium there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to
economics to quantity demanded this is posited to bid the price up at a price above equilibrium there is a surplus of
economics of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded this pushes the price down the model of supply and demand predicts that for
economics for given supply and demand curves price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity
economics quantity demanded similarly demand and supply theory predicts a new price quantity combination from a shift in demand as to the
economics the figure or in supply for a given quantity of a consumer good the point on the demand curve indicates the
economics the value or marginal utility to consumers for that unit it measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for
economics for that unit the corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost the increase in total cost to the supplier
economics supplier for the corresponding unit of the good the price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand in a perfectly
economics perfectly competitive market supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium on the supply side of the market
economics market some factors of production are described as relatively variable in the short run which affects the cost of changing output
economics output levels their usage rates can be changed easily such as electrical power raw material inputs and over time and temp
economics temp work other inputs are relatively fixed such as plant and equipment and key personnel in the long run all inputs
economics inputs may be adjusted by management these distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity responsiveness of the supply curve in the
economics the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand
economics demand side of the market marginalist theory such as above describes the consumers as attempting to reach most preferred positions subject
economics subject to income and wealth constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints including demand for goods
economics goods produced technology and the price of inputs for the consumer that point comes where marginal utility of a good net
economics net of price reaches zero leaving no net gain from further consumption increases analogously the producer compares marginal revenue identical to
economics to price for the perfect competitor against the marginal cost of a good with marginal profit the difference at the point
economics point where marginal profit reaches zero further increases in production of the good stop for movement to market equilibrium and for
economics for changes in equilibrium price and quantity also change at the margin more or less of something rather than necessarily all
economics all or nothing other applications of demand and supply include the distribution of income among the factors of production including labour
economics labour and capital through factor markets in a competitive labour market for example the quantity of labour employed and the price
economics price of labour the wage rate depends on the demand for labour from employers for production and supply of labour from
economics from potential workers labour economics examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of
economics of wages and other labour income labour mobility and un employment productivity through human capital and related public policy issues demand
economics demand and supply analysis is used to explain the behavior of perfectly competitive markets but as a standard of comparison it
economics it can be extended to any type of market it can also be generalized to explain variables across the economy for
economics for example total output d as real gdp and the general price level as studied in macroeconomics tracing the qualitative and
economics and quantitative effects of variables that change supply and demand whether in the short or long run is a standard exercise
economics exercise in applied economics economic theory may also specify conditions such that supply and demand through the market is an efficient
economics efficient mechanism for allocating resources firms main articles theory of the firm industrial organization business economics and managerial economics people frequently
economics frequently do not trade directly on markets instead on the supply side they may work in and produce through firms the
economics the most obvious kinds of firms are corporations partnerships and trusts according to ronald coase people begin to organise their production
economics production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market firms combine labour and
economics and capital and can achieve far greater economies of scale when the average cost per unit declines as more units are
economics are produced than individual market trading in perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand there are many
economics many producers none of which significantly influence price industrial organization generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behavior of
economics of firms that do have significant control of price it considers the structure of such markets and their interactions common market
economics market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition various forms of oligopoly and monopoly managerial economics applies microeconomic analysis to
economics to specific decisions in business firms or other management units it draws heavily from quantitative methods such as operations research and
economics and programming and from statistical methods such as regression analysis in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge a unifying theme
economics theme is the attempt to optimize business decisions including unit cost minimization and profit maximization given the firm s objectives and
economics and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions uncertainty and game theory main articles information economics game theory and financial economics
economics economics uncertainty in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss whether quantifiable as risk or not without it household
economics household behavior would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange of a
economics a single instrument in each market period and there would be no communications industry given its different forms there are various
economics various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents responses to it game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that
economics that considers strategic interactions between agents one kind of uncertainty it provides a mathematical foundation of industrial organization discussed above to
economics to model different types of firm behavior for example in an oligopolistic industry few sellers but equally applicable to wage negotiations
economics negotiations bargaining contract design and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other as
economics as a method heavily used in behavioral economics it postulates that agents choose strategies to maximize their payoffs given the strategies
economics strategies of other agents with at least partially conflicting interests in this it generalizes maximization approaches developed to analyze market actors
economics actors such as in the supply and demand model and allows for incomplete information of actors the field dates from the
economics the classic theory of games and economic behavior by john von neumann and oskar morgenstern it has significant applications seemingly outside
economics outside of economics in such diverse subjects as formulation of nuclear strategies ethics political science and evolutionary biology risk aversion may
economics may stimulate activity that in well functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk as in markets for insurance
economics insurance commodity futures contracts and financial instruments financial economics or simply finance describes the allocation of financial resources it also analyzes
economics analyzes the pricing of financial instruments the financial structure of companies the efficiency and fragility of financial markets financial crises and
economics and related government policy or regulation some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty based on george akerlof
economics akerlof s market for lemons article the paradigm example is of a dodgy second hand car market customers without knowledge of
economics of whether a car is a lemon depress its price below what a quality second hand car would be information asymmetry
economics asymmetry arises here if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it related problems
economics problems in insurance are adverse selection such that those at most risk are most likely to insure say reckless drivers and
economics and moral hazard such that insurance results in riskier behavior say more reckless driving both problems may raise insurance costs and
economics and reduce efficiency in driving otherwise willing transactors from the market incomplete markets moreover attempting to reduce one problem say adverse
economics adverse selection by mandating insurance may add to another say moral hazard information economics which studies such problems has relevance in
economics in subjects such as insurance contract law mechanism design monetary economics and health care applied subjects include market and legal remedies
economics remedies to spread or reduce risk such as warranties government mandated partial insurance restructuring or bankruptcy law inspection and regulation for
economics for quality and information disclosure market failure main articles market failure government failure information economics environmental economics and agricultural economics a
economics a smokestack releasing smoke pollution can be a simple example of market failure if costs of production are not borne by
economics by producers but are by the environment accident victims or others then prices are distorted the term market failure encompasses several
economics several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions although economists categorise market failures differently the ing categories emerge in the main
economics main texts information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market
economics market legal and regulatory remedies as discussed above natural monopoly or the overlapping concepts of practical and technical monopoly is an
economics an extreme case of failure of competition as a restraint on producers the problem is described as one where the more
economics more of a product is made the lower the unit costs are this means it only makes economic sense to have
economics have one producer public goods are goods which are undersupplied in a typical market the defining features are that people can
economics can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at
economics at the same time externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not
economics not reflected in market prices for example air pollution may generate a negative externality and education may generate a positive externality
economics externality less crime etc governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or
economics or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price distortions caused by
economics by these externalities elementary demand and supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due
economics due to a shift in demand or supply in many areas some form of price stickiness is postulated to account for
economics for quantities rather than prices adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side this
economics this includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their
economics their implications for reaching a hypothesized long run equilibrium examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in
economics in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition macroeconomic instability addressed below is a prime source of
economics of market failure whereby a general loss of business confidence or external shock can grind production and distribution to a halt
economics halt undermining ordinary markets that are otherwise sound a woman samples of water from a river environmental scientist sampling water some
economics some specialised fields of economics deal in market failure more than others the economics of the public sector is one example
economics example since where markets fail some kind of regulatory or government programme is the remedy much environmental economics concerns externalities or
economics or public bads policy options include regulations that reflect cost benefit analysis or market solutions that change incentives such as emission
economics emission fees or redefinition of property rights public sector main articles economics of the public sector and public finance see also

economics public sector entity usually government the subject addresses such matters as tax incidence who really pays a particular tax cost benefit
economics benefit analysis of government programs effects on economic efficiency and income distribution of different kinds of spending and taxes and fiscal
economics fiscal politics the latter an aspect of public choice theory models public sector behavior analogously to microeconomics involving interactions of self
economics self interested voters politicians and bureaucrats much of economics is positive seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena normative economics seeks
economics seeks to identify what economies ought to be like welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques
economics techniques to simultaneously determine the allocative efficiency within an economy and the income distribution associated with it it attempts to measure
economics measure social welfare by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society macroeconomics circulation in macroeconomics main article macroeconomics
economics macroeconomics macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions top down that is using a
economics a simplified form of general equilibrium theory such aggregates include national income and output the unemployment rate and price inflation and
economics and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components it also studies effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy
economics policy since at least the s macroeconomics has been characterized by further integration as to micro based modeling of sectors including
economics including rationality of players efficient use of market information and imperfect competition this has addressed a long standing concern about inconsistent
economics inconsistent developments of the same subject macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long term level and growth of national income
economics income such factors include capital accumulation technological change and labour force growth growth main article economic growth a world map with
economics with countries colored in different shades of orange world map showing gdp real growth rates growth economics studies factors that explain
economics explain economic growth the increase in output per capita of a country over a long period of time the same factors
economics factors are used to explain differences in the level of output per capita between countries in particular why some countries grow
economics grow faster than others and whether countries converge at the same rates of growth much studied factors include the rate of
economics of investment population growth and technological change these are represented in theoretical and empirical forms as in the neoclassical and endogenous
economics endogenous growth models and in growth accounting business cycle main article business cycle see also circular flow of income aggregate supply
economics supply aggregate demand unemployment and great depression the economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of macroeconomics as
economics as a separate discipline field of study during the great depression of the s john maynard keynes authored a book entitled
economics entitled the general theory of employment interest and money outlining the key theories of keynesian economics keynes contended that aggregate demand
economics demand for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output he therefore
economics therefore advocated active policy responses by the public sector including monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions
economics actions by the government to stabilize output over the business cycle thus a central conclusion of keynesian economics is that in
economics in some situations no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards full employment levels john hicks is lm model has
economics has been the most influential interpretation of the general theory over the years understanding of the business cycle has branched into
economics into various research programs mostly related to or distinct from keynesianism the neoclassical synthesis refers to the reconciliation of keynesian economics
economics economics with neoclassical economics stating that keynesianism is correct in the short run but qualified by neoclassical like considerations in the
economics the intermediate and long run new classical macroeconomics as distinct from the keynesian view of the business cycle posits market clearing
economics clearing with imperfect information it includes friedman s permanent income hypothesis on consumption and rational expectations theory lead by robert lucas
economics lucas and real business cycle theory in contrast the new keynesian approach retains the rational expectations assumption however it assumes a
economics a variety of market failures in particular new keynesians assume prices and wages are sticky which means they do not adjust
economics adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions thus the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full
economics full employment whereas the new keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run and hence government
economics government and central bank policies are needed because the long run may be very long unemployment main article unemployment percent of
economics of us population employed the amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate the percentage of workers
economics workers without jobs in the labour force the labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs people who are retired
economics retired pursuing education or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labor force unemployment
economics unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes classical unemployment occurs when wages are
economics are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers wages may be too high because of minimum wage
economics wage laws or union activity consistent with classical unemployment frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker but
economics but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment structural unemployment
economics unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers skills and the skills required for open
economics open jobs large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set
economics set of skills are no longer in demand structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of
economics of matching workers with job vacancies but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short
economics short term search process while some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy cyclical unemployment occurs
economics occurs when growth stagnates okun s law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth the original version of okun
economics okun s law states that a increase in output would lead to a decrease in unemployment inflation and monetary policy main
economics main articles inflation and monetary policy see also money quantity theory of money monetary policy and history of money money is
economics is a means of final payment for goods in most price system economies and the unit of account in which prices
economics prices are typically stated a very apt statement by professor walker a well known economist is that money is what money
economics money does money has a general acceptability a relative consistency in value divisibility durability portability elastic in supply and survives with
economics with mass public confidence it includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits it has been described as a
economics a social convention like language useful to one largely because it is useful to others the federal reserve sets monetary policy
economics policy as the central bank of the united states as a medium of exchange money facilitates trade it is essentially a
economics a measure of value and more importantly a store of value being a basis for credit creation its economic function can
economics can be contrasted with barter non monetary exchange given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers barter may entail
economics entail a hard to locate double coincidence of wants as to what is exchanged say apples and a book money can
economics can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability then it is less costly for the seller to
economics to accept money in exchange rather than what the buyer produces at the level of an economy theory and evidence are
economics are consistent with a positive relationship running from the total money supply to the nominal value of total output and to
economics to the general price level for this reason management of the money supply is a key aspect of monetary policy fiscal
economics fiscal policy main articles fiscal policy and government spending governments implement fiscal policy by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter
economics alter aggregate demand when aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy there is an output gap where some
economics some productive capacity is left unemployed governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand resources that have been idled
economics idled can be used by the government for example unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways tax cuts allow
economics allow consumers to increase their spending which boosts aggregate demand both tax cuts and spending have multiplier effects where the initial
economics initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity the effects of fiscal policy
economics policy can be limited by crowding out when there is no output gap the economy is producing at full capacity and
economics and there are no excess productive resources if the government increases spending in this situation the government use resources that otherwise

health pavement so why was i sidelined with a heel injury for over two s i listened to the manufacturer and changed
health changed my runners every miles come to think of it why do i see so many runners with lower extremity injuries
health injuries in my office the traditional answer to these questions has always been overuse often compounded by an underlying mechanical abnormality
health abnormality such as over pronation or flat feet the treatment along with modification of training physiotherapy stretching etc has always included
health included a close look at the runner s footwear often with recommendations about motion control stability cushioning orthotics or custom molded
health molded insoles a growing body of literature in the field of sports medicine however is causing a bit of a stir
health stir no call it panic in the running world everything you and i always believed about running shoes and running injuries
health injuries may be wrong here s the scoop the modern running shoe itself may be the major cause of running injuries
health injuries stated another way the modern running shoe presently thought of a protective device should be reclassified as a health hazard
health hazard nike please tell me it ain t so now relax get back on your chair and take a deep breath
health breath we ll take this one step at a time and since we re going to be talking about shoes and
health and feet i may as well start at the beginning the very beginning until quite recently in our history most humans
health humans lived out their lives unshod s f stewart in his footgear it s history uses and abuses states that all
health all writers who have reported their observations of barefoot peoples agree that the untrammeled feet of natural men are free from
health from the disabilities commonly noted among shod people hallux valgus bunions hammer toe and painful feet so why was footgear developed
health developed one of the earliest examples of footgear known to us the form of sagebrush bark sandals found in caves and
health and rock shelters near fort rock oregon under a layer of volcanic ash dating back years the foot surface is smooth
health smooth and they were held on by bast straps over the instep similar sandals were used throughout the volcanic cordilleras of
health of meso and south america and the volcanic islands of the south pacific the early polynesians used sandals to cross old
health old lava flows and when fishing on the razor sharp coral it seems therefore that the prime function of the earliest
health earliest sandals was protection of the sole although the early pharaohs are all represented as barefoot by the first millennium bc
health bc sandals in egypt were common in court and were worn by soldiers in mesopotamian kingdoms sandals were evidently a status
health status symbol with the king known to have worn a wedged sandal in contrast to his flat soled courtiers very thick
health thick soled low boots are known to have been worn by greek tragedians to increase their height comedians wore socks or
health or soccus hence the expression high tragedy and low comedy thus the secondary function of footgear appears to have been symbolic
health symbolic from the time of the greeks footgear gradually evolved to meet both symbolic and functional needs for example tradition tells
health tells us that about the beginning of the present millennium count fulk of anjou introduced long pointed toes to cover up
health up some deformity of his feet and courtiers quickly adopted the fashion the mongols who on horseback ravaged the middle east
health east between damascus and moscow from the th th centuries are credited for the introduction of the block heel presumably developed
health developed to better grip the stirrup plate but in the french court of louis xiv the rugged mongolian heel underwent a
health a radical cosmetic transformation eventually leading to the ultimate idiotic expression of modern fashion the stiletto heel european peasants wore clogs
health clogs carved from a block of wood mass production seems to have begun prior to the th century for edward ii
health ii in decreed that shoes should be sized their length was measured in barleycorns to an inch this is still the
health the basis of shoe measurements inch to a size in length we start sizing from a baseline of in children and
health and in adults widths vary with length in a given size the widths vary by inch unpaired shoes were introduced in
health in england in the th century when gout became common and these shoes had broad square toes to relieve pressure the
health the most recent innovation seems to have been the hard box toe to preserve the appearance of the shoe now let
health let s focus in on the running shoe it seems that the earliest sports shoes were developed in the s by
health by the liverpool rubber company owned by john boyd dunlop although they were first called sand shoes because they were worn
health worn on the beach by the victorian middle classes they eventually became known as plimsolls because the lines formed by the
health the rubber and canvas bond looked similar to the plimsoll line on a ship s hull in dunlop launched its green
health green flash range of trainers adi dassler and his brother rudolf started making sports shoes in herzogenaurach germany in and in

health the catch if all this high tech stuff is supposed to be preventing running injuries by shielding us from impact why
health why is it that two out of every three runners are sidelined every year because of a running injury why is
health is it that since the great jogging boom of the mid seventies there has been no decrease in the incidence some
health some authors say there has been an increase of running injures in spite of yearly improvements in running shoe technology why
health why is my office filled with runners who have injured knees of running injuries tibias achilles tendons and plantar fascias the
health the cause of all these injuries is quite evident cumulative micro trauma caused by repetitive impact experienced during running the heel
health heel of a runner upon striking the ground generates a force that can equal times body weight at the foot and
health and as much as times body weight at the hip repeat this times per mile and it s easy to appreciate
health appreciate the stress the old bones are under add to this the hardness of urban roadways compared to naturally deposited surfaces
health surfaces and eventually something gives inflammation sets in and pain results and you end up working at the finish line pulling
health pulling bar codes off finishers now where s our high tech shoe in all this with all the improvements in recent
health recent years you d think we d be seeing a marked decrease in running injuries just keep reading it wasn t
health t till the mid eighties that some researchers smelled something rotten in the athletic footwear world and it wasn t just
health just dirty socks footwear manufacturers were well aware that impact was the cause of running injuries and reasoned that the way
health way to attenuate impact was to interpose a soft impact absorbing midsole between the foot and the ground the first major
health major problem was the method used by essentially all the footwear development labs to test the impact absorption of footwear mid
health mid soles dr benno nigg from the university of calgary showed that machine testing of these materials by dropping a kg
health kg object onto the shoe sole and measuring the impact on a pressure plate did not accurately predict human impact with
health with the same materials in fact the correlation turned out to be inverse that is when you drop a kg ball
health ball on materials of increasing softness you measure decreasing impact however when the impact from a running human is measured the
health the result is the reverse and the impact increases with softer materials whoops you ll find out why later next problem
health problem in dr b marti published a paper which still makes the throats of footwear executives go dry he studied runners
health runners who participated in a km race and had them fill out an extensive questionnaire about their running in the year
health year preceding the race here s what he found the incidence of injuries in runners using shoes costing more than was
health was more that twice as great as in runners using shoes costing less than note that this result includes correction for
health for other influencing factors such as training mileage and history of previous injury in other words the fancier high tech advanced
health advanced the shoe the more dangerous it is now a study of over runners is not something to thumb your nose
health nose at and you would think the shoe manufacturers would have taken some notice not on your life yearly athletic shoe
health shoe sales were in the billions of dollars and this was no time to fiddle with a successful product in any
health any case it is felt by many observers that by the mid eighties researchers in house or independent had effectively been
health been forced out of the loop of new product development and that research and development was now exclusively in the hands
health hands of the marketing people athletic shoes had become a fashion item and were designed as such as they are to
health to this day the big question why are super shock absorbing athletic shoes causing more running injuries dr steven robbins from
health from the centre for studies in aging at mcgill university in montreal is the man who came up with the answer
health answer dr robbins pointed out that the human lower extremity is not a delicate rigid passive structure requiring packaging to protect
health protect it from impact this becomes blatantly obvious when one observes the nearly complete absence of foot disorders in unshod populations
health populations people who go around barefoot just don t get plantar fasciitis or any of the other lower extremity injuries so
health so common in shod populations the lower extremity he points out is a rugged flexible active well designed teleologically structure wire
health wire this structure to a spinal cord and a brain and what you ve got is a system fully capable of
health of handling the impacts of running so how does this system work exactly and why do modern running shoes screw it
health it up allow me for a moment to compare the human locomotor apparatus to a modern luxury car the bones of
health of the foot leg thigh and pelvis act as the frame linked by joints and all held together by fairly inelastic
health inelastic ligaments and fascia the bones and joints are surrounded by contracting muscles which act as the suspension system this is
health is especially evident in the arch of the foot which is formed by both the passive rigid plantar fascia as well
health well as the active flexible intrinsic muscles the bones and muscles are covered by fat and skin within which reside receptors
health receptors or sensors that send information to both the peripheral computer the spinal cord and the central computer the brain the
health the skin on the sole of the foot glabrous skin is very well suited to its function possessing about of the
health the toughness of hairy skin the skin everywhere else on our bodies except our palms the receptors in the foot are
health are specially designed to sense both impact vertical force and shear horizontal force add to this information streaming in from pain
health pain receptors as well as joint position receptors throughout the lower extremity and you ve got a hummer got carried away
health away a little sorry during barefoot running the ball of the foot strikes the ground first and immediately starts sending signals
health signals to the spinal cord and brain about the magnitude of impact and shear getting most of its clues about this
health this from the skin contact with the surface irregularities of the ground take away this contact by adding a cushioned substance
health substance and you immediately fool the system into underestimating the impact add a raised heel and the shod runner is forced
health forced to land on it strap the cushioning on tightly with the aid of a sophisticated lacing system and you block
health block out shear as well throwing the shock absorption system even further into the dark the system responds by landing harder
health harder in an attempt to compress the cushion and feel the ground the weight is then transferred to the outside edge
health edge of the foot completely by passing the skin of the arch the heel then touches down and the weight is
health is transferred to the ball again with final push off through the toes while the weight is being transferred the arch
health arch carries out its function as the suspension system of the foot and flattens under the active control of the intrinsic
health intrinsic muscles the ankle knee and hip joints flex to absorb impact in response to information flowing in from the foot
health foot the cushioned midsole of the modern running shoe robs the system of important sensory information necessary for ankle knee and
health and hip response to impact the arch support or orthotic in modern running shoes not only prevents the arch suspension system
health system from absorbing energy by preventing flattening but eventually leads to intrinsic muscle atrophy and complete loss of active muscular control
health control of the arch leaving only the inelastic plantar fascia as a checkrein to flattening the barefoot runner s foot position
health position awareness sense which relies heavily on sensory input from the sole of the foot minimizes his risk of sustaining an
health an ankle sprain on uneven ground the shod runner is at marked increased risk of ankle sprains because his foot position
health position awareness sense is handicapped by the paucity of sensations coming from his soles the barefoot runner is constantly alert scanning
health scanning the ground before him for irregularities and dangers that might cause him injury the barefoot runner is a cautious runner
health runner and actively changes his landing strategy to prevent injury he treads lightly the shod runner is bombarded by convincing advertising
health advertising stating or implying that the shoe he is wearing will protect him well over any terrain and he becomes a
health a careless runner he is heavy footed finally certain diseases in humans can cause a gradual destruction of the sensory nerve
health nerve endings in the foot and elsewhere resulting in a significant increase in lower extremity injuries diabetes and tertiary syphilis are
health are two extremities so affected are termed neuropathic the shod runner because of his sensory deprivation and high risk of injury
health injury may be termed as having pseudo neuropathic feet a term coined by robbins the conclusion that shoes are the primary
health primary cause of running injuries is strongly supported by the scientific literature i ve already mentioned marti s work showing more
health more than twice the incidence of running injuries with expensive shoes compared with cheap ones rao and joseph examined indian children
health children between the ages of and and found that the incidence of flat feet was more than three times greater in
health in those children who used footwear than in those who did not leading them to conclude that shoe wearing in early
health early childhood is detrimental to the development of a normal arch in hamill and bates showed that as running shoes lose
health lose their cushioning through wear and tear subjects improve foot control on testing and presumably decrease their risk of injury i
health i e shoes get better with age robbins and gouw showed in that modern athletic footwear creates a perceptual illusion in
health in subjects whereby they consistently impact simply adding surface irregularities on the insoles to simulate barefoot like conditions markedly improves subjects
health subjects s of impact robbins and others studied the balance ability of men walking along a beam wearing shoes with soles
health soles of varying thickness and hardness results confirmed that the thinner and harder the soles the better the balance in one
health one of their most elegant and widely publicized studies robbins and waked examined the effect of advertising on landing impact they
health they asked subjects to step down barefoot ten times onto four pressure measuring platforms the first one being bare and the
health the other three covered by identical shoe sole material made to look different by different colored cloth the subjects were given
health given different messages for each of the covered plates the message for the first covered plate suggested superior impact absorption and
health and protection deceptive message the second suggested poor impact absorption and high injury risk warning message and the third suggested unknown
health unknown impact absorption and safety neutral message results showed that subjects landed with the highest impact when given the deceptive and
health and neutral messages and with the lowest impact when given the warning message or with the bare plate the authors conclude
health conclude that running injury rates are greatest in users of the most expensive shoes because advertising has deceived these users into
health into believing that the shoes provide a superior level of safety thereby inducing an attenuation of impact moderating behavior increasing impact
health impact and injury the authors add that deceptive advertising of protective devices is a public health hazard and should be addressed
health addressed humans are less cautious even when they use truthfully advertised products because of excessively positive attitudes toward new products and
health and wrong impressions of the standards of truth in advertising so you think is this guy telling me that nike reebock
health reebock and all those big corporations just put this new stuff out on the market without any proof that its safe
health safe can t be well that s exactly what i m telling you i can be a real pain in the
health the ass when i try and some years back i was in the mood i got on the phone and tried
health tried to talk to the directors of research at all the big athletic footwear companies i tell you getting to talk
health talk to one of these guys is harder than talking to the pope i finally got to speak with mr gordon
health gordon valiant then director of research at the nike sports research lab in beaverton oregon jf mr valiant my name is
health is dr froncioni and i m an orthopedic surgeon i treat a lot of runners and i was just wondering what
health what your thoughts were on the whole issue of running injuries possibly being caused by your running shoes long pause gv
health gv umm well i m afraid i m not at liberty to discuss that matter say what jf mr valiant in
health in case you missed it i m not a reporter i m just an orthopedic surgeon who s looking for some
health some answers for his patients let me rephrase surely you have data to support the injury protection claims you make about
health about your running shoes surely sir gv well i could refer you to our marketing people and i m sure they
health they could send you something nope we re not on the same wavelength at all i m sure the lawyers have
health have given these guys a gag order jf mr valiant your marketing people send me stuff all the time it s
health s all over the runner s world i get every anyway nice talking to you i ve also had a few
health few chats with dr steven robbins he feels very strongly that the athletic footwear manufacturers are painting themselves into a very
health very tight corner by not acting on the available information after all it is within their power to effect changes in
health in their shoe design based on the available data and in doing so decreasing the running injury rate by up to
health to by not acting now dr robbins predicts the footwear manufacturers may end up in the same situation as the tobacco
health tobacco companies with massive class action lawsuits brought against them part new directions so what do we do now for starters
health starters no i do not recommend that you run your next half marathon barefoot but certainly i predict that sooner or
health or later changes will come about in both shoe design and training from the medical establishment s point of view the
health the prevention and treatment of running injuries must change to incorporate the concepts outlined above in fact i view the ideas
health ideas i ve presented here as a major paradigm shift in sports medicine the likes of which i have not seen
health seen in the last fifteen years of course the major shoe companies have to own up and start introducing better shoes
health shoes into their lines why not do this gradually and introduce just one shoe that incorporates some of the recommended changes
health changes dr robbins is already testing shoes that use a thinner less resilient midsole material that provides the comfort but not
health not the impact absorption and of course has no arch support i m sure the marketing boys at nike could handle
health handle it without being too radical there are some changes that are worth introducing without further delay and they are as
health as s young children should be encouraged to spend as much time as possible barefoot we know that this is especially
health especially important for the proper formation of the foot arch in the first six years of life so moms trash the
health the weebocks and let your kids develop strong healthy feet just as they were meant to runners should consider incorporating sessions
health sessions of barefoot running into their training in an article in the october runner s world adam bean gives the ing
health ing advice running barefoot a couple of times per week can decrease your risk of injury and boost your push off
health off power you can run on any surface you like as long as you re careful of sharp objects and pebbles
health pebbles soft sand is probably the least desirable surface because it is unstable and after your heel has dug in you
health you will weight bear on your arch paved roads are fine and dangerous objects are easy to spot but remember your
health your feet will need to toughen up so start with small doses kick your shoes off as soon as you get
health get home and spend your evenings and weekends barefoot is it possible to rehabilitate the weakened muscles of a normally shod
health shod runner it certainly is according to another excellent study by dr robbins he asked normally shod recreational runners to gradually
health gradually increase barefoot activity both at home and outdoors over a period of several weeks and to maintain barefoot activity for
health for about four s the runners feet were examined measured and x rayed at regular intervals to detect changes results showed
health showed marked improvement in the anatomy and function of the arch the authors concluded that the normally shod foot is capable
health capable of rehabilitation of foot musculature very good news indeed for all of us runners may want to consider switching to
health to a lightweight shoe that provides less cushioning and no arch support the only shoes on the market that come close
health close to these characteristics are racing flats i use the oz asics gel magic racer for you diehard nike fans consider
health consider the air streak ii air streak spectrum plus or the air streak vapor iv but most shoe manufactures make a
health a flat a shoe that nike has just introduced this year the nike free also looks like a step in the
health the right direction i have not actually seen this shoe myself yet moreover a look at the nike free web page
health page give me a bit of hope that this company may finally have seen the light if you do change to
health to flats i recommend you wean into them slowly remember that you live in a developed country and that your feet
health feet have been shielded from natural stresses your entire life i e you ve got wimpy feet buddy the intrinsic muscles
health muscles of your feet are asleep and need to wake up slowly the first thing that will strike you in a
health a racing flat is the lightness of the shoe most runners today run in shoes that weigh as much as oz
health oz then you will quickly realize that for the first time you start to feel the ground you are walking on
health on oh and one more thing don t listen to the guy at the running store he s there to sell
health sell shoes and is under the spell of the powerful shoe industry advertising machine he has become well and truly brainwashed
health brainwashed with the traditional concepts that we all need cushioning and arch support he will try to dissuade you from buying
health buying a racing flat and he may even go as far as telling you that they are for elite runners and
health and are meant to be used for one marathon only don t believe him i keep my flats for at least
health least miles with no problem finally some radicals among you may wish to become full time barefoot runners barefoot running clubs
health clubs are springing up all over america and europe point your search engine to barefoot running shoes and stress fracture s

health as often as i can my back actually feels stronger and i no longer get the achiness and fatigue anyway check
health check them out thanks again posted by julie a february at pm in general besides a couple of details the general
health general story is pretty sound however i would not suggest people run barefoot on hard man made surfaces pavements etc you
health you will damage yourself if you train extensively like this a nice viewpoint is to apply logical thinking and think how
health how humans evolved we evolved running on soft sand and hard surfaces dried compacted mud so you can run on the
health the pavement i hear you say well no even though you might not feel it there is a lot of cushioning
health cushioning even on a dry mud surface when compared to concrete pavement these fancy cushion style running shoes started life by
health by trying to reintroduce some of this cushioning but as usual man has taken it to the n th degree such
health such that it is now detrimental as the article points out the details a couple of the facts in your story
health story have been miss interpreted but as i said in general the message is pretty good so don t take this
health this the wrong way for instance the argument about people in third world countries not having problems and not wearing footwear
health footwear is a bit of a leap of faith you are assuming a correlation between two factors in a massively complex
health complex and multi factorial system there are many other possible explanations eg their cultures are such that they are less likely
health likely to admit pain and or are more likely to put up with pain than have a major operation this final
health final point in also evident in japan where rates of joint replacement in patients under are extremely low when compared to
health to european and the us when you ask the patients surgeons why the answer is purely because they do not think
health think it a good idea in european and the us we have become so demanding we expect to live longer and
health and to be able to do the same things if something breaks then it must be fixed this is crazy culture
health culture and evident in the way we must sue someone for any action possible if trip in the street we sue
health sue the government for make a poor foot path etc etc a general rant as for the marketing machine i agree
health agree totally and utterly but that s life if you see anything just in our western world i d be amazed
health amazed from cosmetics to cars to health care products they are all using the freud s psychology to make sure we
health we buy buy buy on a functional basis there are v few things that we need but the world economy would
health would stop if we didn t buy a new car every three years get that new phone drink that health shake
health shake little to say what our neighbours would think unfortunately we have chosen the wrong social model and it s going
health going to take a long time for us to bounce back in the right direction pants i hear you say well
health well yes for most people but just use your brain as the author of this article has done don t believe
health believe everything you hear and most of all come to your own conclusions ps i m not saying become a hippy
health hippy heaven forbid just educate yourself read about social science body language etc etc and it becomes pretty obvious that we
health we can rectify some of these issues on a personal level at least then is a couple of generations we ll

health wait for the warmer weather so i can kick off the shoes a few times a week posted by john february
health february at pm i would also like to ask about the rigid orthopedic arch supports you put them in your shoes
health shoes like the dr scholl s implants i was given them because my arch supposedly does not support itself but i
health i never wore them because they were too uncomfortable blisters etc i m not sure what this means in respect to
health to the information presented can anyone shed some light on this so do you minimalist shoe wearers wear socks too if
health if so what kind i m also curious what kind of shoes do the olympics sprinters use since i ve never

health much more than the nike free i bought the nike free and it s a step in the right direction for
health for nike but it still has quite a heel compared to something like the vibram fivefingers in other words you will

health ignored by most the experts in the sports medicine industry i applaud you publishing this and encourage you to spread the

health for protection against dangerous ground and i don t include your average city street in this even dirty cities like new
health new york san francisco or oakland all of which i have walked barefoot in posted by zach february at am maybe
health maybe i am overstimating the impact but have there been any comparative studies of running induced injuries in those raised in
health in currently living in asian homes no shoes when inside usually and those raised in western homes shoes inside more often
health often than not or studies from which such a comparison could be inferred conclusive evidence might be hard to come by
health by but a comparison between injury rates of japanese and american runners probably as close a socioeconomic match as you re

health pm this is an interesting article and poses a very serious issue however i think there is an issue that is
health is just as serious adults do not know how to run after years of stress and sitting at a desk all
health all day long they forgot how to run if you look at children running their form is much different than adults
health adults the reason is they run naturally adults have forgotten how to do this and run unnaturally if you make your
health your body do something for a long period of time in a way that is not natural for it then you
health you will cause problems so there seems to be problems at stake here people don t run correctly people think shoes
health shoes will compensate for all of this if you want to know what i am talking about when it comes to
health to running correctly check out chi running yeah it sounds a little hokie but it makes a lot of sense if
health if you have done it posted by peter february at pm awesome article doc well and informative i never would have

health free the lesser the shoe was involved the healthier the person long term posted by john february at pm i think
health think it is suggestive that soccer players who on average will run miles during the course of a minute game play

health hangperson s noose is unmistakably around the tobacco industry s neck in florida and mississippi state governments are attempting to force
health force tobacco companies to pay some smoking related health care costs in washington d c the environmental protection agency has claimed
health claimed that secondhand smoke is a significant risk for nonsmokers and the food drug administration is making noises about regulating nicotine
health nicotine as a drug and recently the american medical association agreed reasserting that nicotine is addictive smokers have already been driven
health driven away from many workplaces into the street for a furtive puff but further legal harassment to the point of what
health what an industry spokesman calls backdoor prohibition seems unstoppable lost in this lynching frenzy the fact that smoking might be in
health in some small ways good for you hold on now let s be clear the surgeon general has indeed determined that
health that smoking is dangerous to your health lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases are highly correlated with cigarette consumption annual smoking related
health related deaths are commonly said to be over although critics say the number is inflated but so is driving automobiles dangerous
health dangerous to your health over deaths a year yet people do it because it has rewards as well as risk and
health and they judge as individuals that the reward outweighs the risk this is called freedom well what are the rewards of
health of cigarette smoking apart from intangible pleasure the most obvious is behavioral a battery of studies such as those by british
health british researcher d m warburton show that cigarettes whatever their other effects really do stimulate alertness dexterity and cognitive capacity and
health and alertness dexterity etc can be useful such as when driving or flying as congress recognized when it exempted airline pilots
health pilots from the ban on smoking on domestic flights these behavioral benefits suggest an answer to the great tobacco mystery why
health why almost a third of adult americans continue to do something they are told incessantly and insistently is bad for them
health them duke university economist w kip viscusi reported in his book smoking making the risky decision that survey data show smokers
health smokers if anything exaggerate the health danger of their habit smokers according to numerous studies such as those by university of
health of michigan researchers ovide and cynthia pomerleau are different from nonsmokers they tend toward depression and excitability current understanding is that
health that nicotine is amphoteric that is it can act to counter both conditions depending on how it is consumed quick puffs
health puffs stimulate long drags calm the implication is fascinating a large part of the population seems to be aware of its
health its significant although not pathological personality quirks and to have discovered a form of self medication that regulates them of course
health course this explanation for the stubbornness of smokers is not as satisfying as what washington prefers to believe mass seduction by
health by the wicked tobacco companies and their irresistible advertising nor would it justify huge rescue operations by heroic politicians and bureaucrats
health bureaucrats beyond its behavioral effects smoking seems also to offer subtler health rewards to balance against its undisputed risks parkinson s

health among nonsmokers an effect recognized by the surgeon general as along ago as alzheimer s disease similarly the frequency of this

health example by the h studies reviewed in the international journal of epidemiology in endometrial cancer there is extensive and long standing
health standing evidence that this disease of the womb occurs as much as less among smokers as documented by for example a
health a new england journal of medicine article back in the triggering mechanism appears to be a reduction of estrogen levels prostate
health prostate cancer conversely smoking seems to raise estrogen levels in men and may be responsible for what appears to be a

health2 some people appear to be born with superhero dna that cancels out genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis say researchers the study
health2 study of nearly people found who should have developed debilitating diseases but did not the hope is discovering what against the
health2 the odds keeps them healthy and if that could lead to new therapies experts said the approach published in nature biotechnology
health2 biotechnology was fascinating but that it was still early days errors in our code of life our dna can cause disease
health2 disease large numbers of studies have tried to understand these mutations by looking at people who become ill but the international
health2 international team of researchers tried the opposite approach searching for people harbouring damaging mutations but who remain healthy millions of years
health2 years of evolution have produced far more protective mechanisms than we currently understand said dr eric schadt from the icahn school
health2 school of medicine at mount sinai hospital in new york he added most genomic studies focus on finding the cause of
health2 of a disease but we see tremendous opportunity in figuring out what keeps people healthy the researchers scoured dna databases containing

health2 would have manifested the disease without it being clearly annotated in their health records prof stephen friend from the icahn school
health2 school of medicine said finding these individuals is a starting point to searching for the other changes eg in the genome
health2 genome that might give us clues to develop therapies study the healthy don t just study the sick however this is
health2 is where the tantalising story ends the scientists were unable to go out and find the lucky because of the consent
health2 consent rules signed when their dna sample was taken it means they do not know what is protecting them against disease
health2 disease it also leaves the team unable to prove that errors in testing bad record keeping or mosaicism in which the
health2 the genetic defect affects only some cells in the body are not behind their findings because of the inability to confirm
health2 confirm the source or validity of the variants and the inability to recontact the individuals this paper does not constitute a
health2 a proof of principle dr ada hamosh from johns hopkins university argued and while dr scott hebbring from the university of
health2 of wisconsin described the study as fascinating he also cautioned that diseases can present very differently even between patients that have
health2 have same mutations some may have few symptoms at all the research group is aiming to do a new study from
health2 from scratch where patients can be traced it also argues that other forms of protection from infections to dementia could be
health2 be detected through this approach dr daniel macarthur from the massachusetts general hospital said finding genetic superheroes will require other kinds
health2 kinds of heroism a willingness of participants to donate their genomic and clinical data and a commitment by researchers and regulators
health2 regulators to overcome the daunting obstacles to data sharing on a global scale dr matthew hurles from the wellcome trust sanger
health2 sanger institute said the study exemplifies the often unforeseen benefits that can be achieved from responsible sharing of anonymised genetic and
health2 and clinical data however he added the full benefits of such altruistic data sharing is only fully realised when it becomes
health2 becomes possible to go back to the resilient individual to try to understand how their resilience is achieved this poses research
health2 research and ethical questions personally if i were that individual i d happily share my genome if it could help someone
health2 someone else who had been dealt a less favourable genetic hand the zika virus is scarier than first thought and its
health2 its impact on the us could be greater than predicted public health officials have admitted a wider range of birth defects
health2 defects has been linked to the virus said dr anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention and
health2 and the mosquitoes that carry the virus could travel to more us states than previously thought she said the current zika
health2 zika outbreak began almost a year ago in brazil it has been linked to thousands of birth defects in the americas
health2 americas most of what we ve learned is not reassuring said dr schuchat at white house briefing on monday everything we
health2 we know about this virus seems to be scarier than we initially thought earlier this year us president obama asked the
health2 the us congress for bn bn in emergency funding to combat the virus in the meantime it has been using money
health2 money totalling m left over from the ebola virus fund that was a temporary stopgap and inadequate to get the job
health2 job done said dr anthony fauci of the national institutes of health the us now needs more money to fight the
health2 the mosquitoes and to fund better research into vaccines and treatments he said when the president asked for billion we needed
health2 needed billion without want to be alarmist he said there had been recent discoveries about how destructive zika appeared to be
health2 be to foetal brains there were also reports of rare neurologic problems in adults he said the cdc announced that puerto
health2 puerto rico is to receive m in emergency zika funding as the number of cases there doubles every week in february
health2 february the first us case of locally transmitted zika was reported in dallas texas spread through sexual contact not a mosquito
health2 mosquito bite scientists have made a significant leap towards mass producing platelets the part of the blood that forms clots the
health2 the nhs and university of cambridge team have discovered how to grow the body s platelet factories in the laboratory it
health2 it could provide a new source of platelets to stop heavy bleeding for example after a car crash but the researchers
health2 researchers need to make the process more efficient before starting trials if you donate blood then it is separated out into
health2 into red blood cells plasma and platelets so patients are given only the component they need platelets are needed after trauma
health2 trauma surgery leukaemia therapy and in some blood disorders like haemophilia we re totally dependent on blood donation to produce those
health2 those platelets said dr cedric ghevaert a consultant haematologist his team has been trying to grow megakaryocytes the platelet mother cells
health2 cells that live in your bone marrow and manufacture the clotting platelets their breakthrough reported in the journal nature communications was
health2 was the discovery of a set of chemical switches needed to create megakaryocytes in the lab dr ghevaert from nhs blood
health2 blood and transplant described their results as a major step forward and told the bbc news website that the next big
health2 big step is to get enough platelets out of each megakaryocyte the lab made cells produce around platelets each but each
health2 each one functioning normally in the bone marrow would produce up to it is hoped that recreating the same conditions as
health2 as in the bone marrow could make the cells more effective if the researchers are successful then lab grown platelets could
health2 could be more useful than ones collected in a blood donation dr ghevaert added we can modify the platelets so they
health2 they can trigger the clotting even better which would have huge advantages indeed for patients who have had a crash or
health2 or a bleed or even in soldiers who have been injured it could also allow doctors to have stockpiles customised to
health2 to different patients platelets come in different forms just as red blood cells come in a b o and ab and
health2 and some platelet types particularly those common in black and asian ethnic groups are relatively rare scientists have unravelled one of
health2 of the secrets of a plant used in traditional chinese medicine the chinese skullcap known as huang qin is traditionally used

health2 as flavones flavones are found widely in the plant kingdom giving some plants vivid blue flowers the root is thought to
health2 to have anti viral propertiesimage copyrightqing zhao chinese academy of sciences the root is thought to have anti viral properties understanding
health2 understanding the pathway should help us to produce these special flavones in large quantities which will enable further research into their
health2 their potential medicinal uses said prof martin it s exciting to consider that the plants which have been used as traditional
health2 traditional chinese remedies for thousands of years may lead to effective modern medicines previous lab research suggests that flavones have anti
health2 anti cancer properties offering hope that they may one day lead to effective cancer treatments commenting on the study dr alan
health2 alan worsley of cancer research uk said this paper answers a very interesting biological question about how these plants are able
health2 able to make particular molecules but the study doesn t look at whether the molecules can be used to treat cancer
health2 cancer instead it looks at how this compound is made in nature which may allow scientists to make more of it
health2 it in the lab and be able to research its potential uses this herb is a member of the mint family

health2 does not help diabetes either stress turks it feels need to adopt a new approach to increase their quality of life
health2 life eating healthy food exercising more and keeping a quiet mind seem to be the recipe action the who report said
health2 said the solution required the whole of society to act the easy solution is for all of us to exercise eat
health2 eat healthily and not gain excess weight of course it s not so easy said dr krug he called for governments
health2 governments to regulate the fat and sugar content of foods to ensure there were healthy options available to people better urban
health2 urban planning that enabled people to cycle and walk was also essential as was encouraging breastfeeding he added and he also
health2 also called on the food industry to act responsibly to ensure it reduced the fat and sugar content of foods and
health2 and to cease marketing unhealthy foods to young people it is only by keeping blood sugar levels in check that the
health2 the deadly complications of the disease can be contained but the report showed that two thirds of low income countries were
health2 were not able to provide blood sugar monitors or drugs such as insulin or metformin for most people dr krug concluded
health2 concluded two things really worry me when i read this report one is that one in people today have diabetes and
health2 and the other is the lack of fairness today in most low income countries people who have diabetes and need access
health2 access to medicine and technology to manage it don t have access to it vitamin d supplements may help people with
health2 with diseased hearts a study suggests a trial on heart failure patients found supplements of the vitamin which is made in
health2 in the skin when exposed to sunlight improved their hearts ability to pump blood around the body the leeds teaching hospitals
health2 hospitals team who presented at a meeting of the american college of cardiology described the results as stunning the british heart
health2 heart foundation called for longer trials to assess the pills vitamin d is vital for healthy bones and teeth and may
health2 may have important health benefits throughout the body but many people are deficient no safe way to suntan warning the average
health2 average age of people in the study was and like many people that age they had low levels of vitamin d
health2 d even in summer they do spend less time outside but the skin s ability to manufacture vitamin d also gets
health2 gets less effective with age and we don t really understand why that is said consultant cardiologist dr klaus witte patients
health2 patients were given either a microgram vitamin d tablet or a sugar pill placebo each day for a year and researchers
health2 researchers measured the impact on heart failure a condition in which the heart becomes too weak to pump blood properly the
health2 the key measure was the ejection fraction the amount of blood pumped out of the chambers of the heart with each
health2 each beat in a healthy adult the figure is between and but only a quarter of the blood in the heart
health2 heart was being successfully pumped out in the heart failure patients but in those taking the vitamin pills the ejection fraction
health2 fraction increased from to dr witte told the bbc news website it s quite a big deal that s as big
health2 big as you d expect from other more expensive treatments that we use it s a stunning effect it s as
health2 as cheap as chips has no side effects and a stunning improvement on people already on optimal medical therapy it is
health2 is the first time anyone has shown something like this in the last years the study also showed the patients hearts
health2 hearts became smaller a suggestion they are becoming more powerful and efficient in the uk people over are advised to take
health2 take microgram supplements of the vitamin however dr witte does not think high dose vitamin d should be routine prescribed just
health2 just yet he told the bbc we re a little bit off that yet not because i don t believe it
health2 it but data have shown improvements in heart function they may show improvements in symptoms and we now need a large
health2 large study it is also not clear exactly how vitamin d is improving heart function but it is thought every cell
health2 cell in the body responds to the vitamin most vitamin d comes from sunlight although it is also found in oily
health2 oily fish eggs and is added to some foods such as breakfast cereals prof peter weissberg from the british heart foundation
health2 foundation cautioned that the patients seemed no better at exercise and added a much bigger study over a longer period of
health2 of time is now needed to determine whether these changes in cardiac function can translate into fewer symptoms and longer lives
health2 lives for heart failure patients in january us president barack obama announced a moonshot for cancer let s make america the
health2 the country that cures cancer once and for all he said in his last state of the nation address president obama
health2 obama put vice president joe biden in charge of mission control for mr biden it s personal he lost his son
health2 son beau to brain cancer at the age of last year the cancer moonshot is a bn m injection of cash
health2 cash intended to bring a decade s worth of advances in just five years it is focusing on new approaches such
health2 such as combining treatments and immunotherapy when drugs make the patient s own immune system turn against cancer cells there will
health2 will also be more resources for new gene technologies to improve cancer detection a further area of research is into more
health2 more vaccines to prevent cancer mr biden sees his role as breaking down walls and bringing all the cancer fighters together
health2 together today many hospitals do not share data doctors don t always know about the latest successful therapies we re going
health2 going to make sure this information is shared so an oncologist in austin texas can get access to information at md
health2 md anderson a major cancer institute at the university of texas where my son was treated geographically close but no access
health2 access said mr biden earlier this year more precise surgery there have been considerable improvements in recent decades in some cancer
health2 cancer treatments thirty years ago patients with a cancer diagnosis had a one in four chance of surviving for more than
health2 than years now that figure is close to one in two underlying that general picture it s a very mixed story
health2 story says prof nic jones of manchester university and research lead for cancer research uk in testicular cancer and breast cancer
health2 cancer tremendous progress has been made but in lung pancreatic and brain cancer really very little progress has been made we
health2 we really need to focus our research effort on these areas a combination of targeted treatments better and earlier diagnosis and
health2 and more precise surgery and radiotherapy has led to longer survival changing lifestyles such as giving up smoking has also made
health2 made a difference immunotherapy is starting to make an impact but only on a few patients joe biden is leading the
health2 the moonshot adrian webb is one of the lucky ones in he noticed that he had a mole that had changed
health2 changed colour it turned out to be a malignant melanoma after initial treatment the disease returned and this time it had
health2 had spread he was given a year to live his doctor at queen elizabeth hospital in birmingham gave him a chance
health2 chance to be in a clinical trial of immunotherapy after months i was told that i was part of the team
health2 team the therapy hadn t worked for the other he said the cancer had shrunk remarkably to a small part of
health2 of mr webb s lung he is now well enough to run marathons there are still considerable challenges for cancer researchers
health2 researchers and doctors to discover successful and safe treatments we do not have magic bullets drug costs prof jones says cancer
health2 cancer is the most complex disease that we know of every individual is unique in the changes that have occurred to
health2 to give cancer we need to understand cancer at a molecular level to develop more accurate treatments the new immunotherapy treatments
health2 treatments are very expensive everywhere in the world the associate director for cancer prevention and control at the university of kentucky
health2 kentucky prof thomas tucker says the cancer moonshot money could be put to better use this will be valuable for pharmaceutical
health2 pharmaceutical companies problem is how do we pay for drugs that cost per month in the us prof tucker would like
health2 like to see another bn spent on prevention of million new cases diagnosed each year in the us at least one
health2 one third could be prevented if one third fewer people got cancer what kind of cost savings would that generate president
health2 president nixon announced his war on cancer in cancer research uk is another organisation with moonshot like aims earmarking m to
health2 to spend on five winning ideas to tackle some of the most important unanswered questions in cancer research but are campaigns
health2 campaigns like these the best way to improve cancer survival more than four decades ago another american president made his own
health2 own attempt in richard nixon launched what was a called a war on cancer but that war is still not won
health2 won the force behind the campaign was the socialite and philanthropist mary lasker dr claire pomeroy president of the lasker foundation
health2 foundation said the philanthropist s motivation dated back to when she was young visiting the family s laundress who d just
health2 just had radical mastectomy for breast cancer back at a time when people didn t talk about cancer she was really
health2 really struck by the suffering and the hopelessness ms lasker put a whole page advert in the washington post and new
health2 new york times asking president nixon to start a war on cancer it had an enormous impact and rather than cutting
health2 cutting the cancer research budget the president increased it his advisers brought in the scientists who had got men to the
health2 the moon they reckoned they could find a cure for cancer in seven years but curing cancer turned out to be
health2 be much more complicated than putting men on the moon did president nixon s war on cancer achieve anything medical historian
health2 historian dr carsten timmermann of manchester university says a lot of new findings were already under way for example in molecular
health2 molecular biology for patients there were not many tangible benefits there was publicity about the war on cancer the declaration of
health2 of war may have contributed to the disappearance of stigma around cancer disappearance of stigma helps because people go and talk

health you want to maximize your success while achieving the best possible balance in your life you may want to take a
health a fresh look at what time you wake up and what you do with your time before getting to the office
health office a wakeup call last week i contacted some of the business leaders i greatly admire and inquired about their early
health early morning schedules specifically i asked ceos and top executives what time they wake up when they have their first cup
health cup of coffee when they start on email what if anything they do for exercise what time they leave for the
health the office and what else they do before walking out the door i heard back from half a dozen of them
health them within minutes and in a matter of a few hours i received answers from a total of out of the

health patterns to emerge based on an analysis of the executives schedules and activities i discovered seven practices you should seriously consider
health consider adopting in order to make the most of your morning start early this is the part of your morning routine

health at lunchtime quot he says quot i block the time every single day this is because i m a runner and
health and that s the best time to run outside all year long quot be thoughtful about the source form and timing

health the full novice training schedule hit the button for the full novice training schedule people differ greatly in ability but ideally
health ideally before starting a marathon program you should have been running about a year you should be able to comfortably run
health run distances between and miles you should be training days a week averaging miles a week you should have run an
health an occasional k or k race it is possible to run a marathon with less of a training base particularly if
health if you come from another sport but the higher your fitness level the easier this week program will be this program
health program consists of several different increments long runs the key to the program is the long run on weekends which builds
health builds from miles in week to miles in the climactic week after that you taper to get ready for the marathon
health marathon you can skip an occasional workout or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments but do not cheat on the
health the long runs notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer every third week is a stepback week where
health where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward rest is an important component of
health of any training program run slow normally i recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from to seconds per mile
health mile slower than their marathon pace the problem with offering this advice to novice runners however is that you probably don
health don t know what your marathon pace is because you ve never run a marathon before don t worry simply do
health do your long runs at a comfortable pace one that allows you to converse with your training partners at least during
health during the beginning of the run toward the end you may need to abandon conversation and concentrate on the act of
health of putting one foot in front of the other to finish however if you find yourself finishing at a pace significantly
health significantly slower than your pace in the first few miles you probably need to start much slower or include regular walking
health walking breaks it s better to run too slow during these long runs than too fast the important point is that
health that you cover the prescribed distance how fast you cover it doesn t matter walking breaks that includes walking breaks walking
health walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a marathon it works during training runs too while some coaches
health coaches recommend walking minute out of every or walking minute every mile in the cara marathon training class we teach runners
health runners to walk when they come to an aid station this serves a double function you can drink more easily while
health while walking as opposed to running and since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations you ll be less
health less likely to block those behind it s a good idea to this strategy in training as well our class that
health that trains on the lakefront finds water fountains also known as bubblers every mile or more often we teach them to
health to stop frequently to drink our classes that train elsewhere in the suburbs don t always have easy access to fluids
health fluids but we teach them to wear a water belt and also stop frequently to drink you will lose less time
health time walking than you think i once ran a marathon walking through every aid station my son kevin ran and qualified
health qualified for the olympic trials employing a similar strategy and bill rodgers took four brief breaks tying a shoe on one
health one of them while running and winning the boston marathon walking gives your body a chance to rest and you ll
health ll be able to continue running more comfortably it s best to walk when you want to not when your fatigued
health fatigued body forces you too cross training sundays in this training program are devoted to cross training what is cross training
health training it is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting usually after
health after your long run in this program we run long on saturdays and cross train on sundays although it certainly is
health is possible to reverse that order the best cross training exercises are swimming cycling or even walking what about sports such
health such as tennis or basketball activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice particularly as the mileage builds up
health up toward the end of the program you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that
health that requires sudden stopping and starting one tip you don t have to cross train the same each weekend and you
health you could even combine two or more exercises walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a
health a health club cross training for an hour on sunday will help you recover after your saturday long runs midweek training
health training training during the week also should be done at a comparatively easy pace as the weekend mileage builds the weekday
health weekday mileage also builds add up the numbers and you ll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the
health the week as you do during long runs on the weekends midweek workouts on wednesdays build from to miles i call
health call these my sorta long runs there are similar slight advances on tuesdays and thursdays the program is built on the
health the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start that sounds logical doesn t it believe me
health me as tens of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved it works rest despite my listing it at the
health the end rest is an important component of this or any training program scientists will tell you that it is during

health aerobic and anaerobic aerobic exercise is muscle movement that uses oxygen to burn both carbohydrates and fats to produce energy while
health while anaerobic exercise is muscle movement that does not require oxygen and only burns carbohydrates to produce energy in practice aerobic
health aerobic exercise means activities such as walking bicycling or swimming that temporarily increase your heart rate and respiration aerobic exercise also
health also known as cardiovascular exercise builds your endurance anaerobic exercise typically means activities such as weightlifting and push ups and sit
health sit ups which builds muscle and physical strength through short bursts of strenuous activity an ideal exercise program should include both
health both aerobic and anaerobic exercise basal metabolic rate bmr bmr is the number of calories per day your body burns at
health at rest to maintain normal body functions such as breathing breaking down food and keeping your heart and brain working your
health your age sex height weight and level of physical activity influence your bmr it tends to go down as you get
health get older but it may rise if you begin exercising regularly and building more muscle mass most people s bmr is
health is between and there is no target number but it can be helpful to know yours if you re starting an
health an exercise program with the goal of losing weight since you may want to know how many calories you re getting
health getting from food vs how many your body burns each day without exercise you can get an by using an on
health on line bmr calculator endurance training vs strength or resistance training these terms correlate with aerobic and anaerobic exercise aerobic exercise
health exercise builds endurance and anaerobic exercise builds strength since strength training often involves using muscles to work against the force of
health of weights it s also known as resistance training strength training boosts the amount of muscle in your body by making
health making your muscles work harder than they re used to another important difference is that endurance training should be done on
health on most days but strength training should be performed only two or three times a week in order to give your
health your muscles time to recover isotonic vs isometric exercise isotonic and isometric are both types of exercises people can do during
health during strength training isotonic exercise occurs when faced with resistance it can overcome a muscle contracts and temporarily shortens thereby moving
health moving the attached joint a set of bench presses or chin ups are examples of isotonic exercise by contrast isometric exercise
health exercise occurs when the muscle contracts against a fixed resistance so no muscle shortening or joint movement occurs examples include pushing
health pushing against a wall or trying to a lift a weight that s too heavy to budge isotonic exercise builds muscle
health muscle strength and endurance without overtaxing your cardiovascular system so it s usually the foundation of a strength training program isometric
health isometric exercise quickly builds muscle strength but it should be done with caution or avoided altogether because it s stressful on

health physical activity requires and as a result its intensity one met is the d energy cost of sitting quietly as you
health you engage in more vigorous activity your oxygen demands go up and so do the mets assigned to that activity for
health for example activities such as walking slowly yoga and housework use about mets fast walking and doubles tennis use to and
health and jogging shoveling snow and singles tennis use more than the typical person uses about milliliters of oxygen per kilogram pounds
health pounds of body weight per minute that s referred to as a single met another way to think about it a
health a single met is your activity intensity when you are sitting around doing nothing an activity is rated at mets if
health if it requires twice as much oxygen as simply sitting milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute at
health at mets if it requires four times as much oxygen and so forth sometimes met minutes or met hours are used
health used to take into account how long someone exercises if you walk at a pace of three miles per hour for
health for minutes you accumulate a grand total of met minutes mets x minutes met minutes jog at a pace of five
health five miles per hour for minutes and met minutes redound to your physical activity credit mets x minutes met minutes physical
health physical activity physical activity is any movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscle that increases energy expenditure above a basal
health basal level it can be categorized by mode walking biking rowing and so and by the intensity how much work is
health is being performed sometimes exercise experts use relative intensity which is a person s subjective assessment of how much effort they
health they were making during a physical activity the borg scale is commonly used to measure this perceived exertion target heart rate
health rate several measures of your heart rate can be useful when you begin an exercise program in addition to the number
health number of beats per minute when you re idle resting heart rate and the number during peak physical activity such as
health as a stress test maximum heart rate there s your target heart rate a goal that gives your heart and lungs
health lungs the most benefit from a workout experts typically advise people to aim for a target heart rate of of their
health their maximum rate when they re starting out and as high as as fitness improves most people s resting heart rate
health rate is to beats per minute and maximum heart rate is typically about minus your age e g for a year
health year old you can check whether you re hitting your target heart rate during exercise by feeling your pulse frequently or
health or wearing a heart rate monitor many health centers have aerobic exercise machines with built in heart rate monitors vo max
health max vo max is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during peak exertion v is for volume usually

health we ll swallow it by the bucket load according to some s around half the adults in the us take antioxidant
health antioxidant pills daily in the belief they promote good health and stave off disease we have become antioxidant devotees but are
health are they doing us any good evidence gathered over the past few years shows that at best antioxidant supplements do little
health little or nothing to benefit our health at worst they may even have the opposite effect promoting the very problems they
health they are supposed to stamp out it s little surprise that antioxidants have acquired a reputation as miracle health supplements as
health as long ago as the s scientists discovered that many diseases including heart disease strokes cancer diabetes cataracts arthritis and neurodegenerative
health neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson s and alzheimer s were linked to damage caused by highly destructive chemicals called free radicals
health radicals free radicals are compounds with unpaired electrons that stabilise themselves by oxidising other molecules including proteins carbohydrates lipids and dna
health dna in the process they often create more free radicals sparking off a chain of destruction oxidative damage accompanies most if
health if not all diseases and has even been proposed as a direct cause of some including lung cancer atherosclerosis and alzheimer
health alzheimer s free radicals are an unavoidable hazard of being alive we live in an oxygen rich atmosphere and radicals particularly
health particularly reactive oxygen species ros are natural by products of respiration one per cent of the oxygen we consume turns into
health into ros says biochemist barry halliwell from the national university of singapore it doesn t sound like much but humans are
health are big animals and we breathe a lot over a year a human body makes kilo of ros exposure to x
health x rays ozone tobacco smoke air pollutants microbial infections industrial chemicals and intensive exercise also trigger free radical production in the
health the s however a potential weapon against free radical damage appeared on the horizon scientists had known for a long time
health time that people whose diets are rich in fruits and vegetables have a lower incidence of heart disease diabetes dementia stroke
health stroke and certain types of cancer the very diseases that are associated with free radical damage now there was an explanation
health explanation fruits and vegetables are a rich source of antioxidants that can neutralise free radicals by donating electrons to them green
health green plants are full of antioxidants for good reason they are especially vulnerable to oxidative stress since they produce pure oxygen
health oxygen during photosynthesis to protect themselves they manufacture an assortment of potent antioxidants and so a hypothesis was born dietary antioxidants
health antioxidants are free radical sponges that can stave off the diseases of old age it was a great idea putting two
health two and two together scientists assumed that these antioxidants were protective and that taking them as supplements or in fortified foods
health foods should decrease oxidative damage and diminish disease says halliwell who pioneered research into free radicals and disease it was simple
health simple we said free radicals are bad antioxidants are good the concept helped spawn a colossal supplements industry according to the
health the us national institutes of health nih more than half of us adults take some form of vitamin or mineral supplement
health supplement at a total cost of billion a year the bewildering range of supplements on the shelves makes it hard to
health to say how much of this expenditure goes on antioxidants but the nih says it is probably a large proportion and
health and their popularity just keeps on growing spins a market research firm based in san francisco s that the antioxidant market
health market has grown by per cent in the past year alone the best known antioxidants are vitamin e also known by
health by its chemical name tocopherol vitamin c and two broad classes of plant chemicals called polyphenols including flavonoids and carotenoids including
health including beta carotene and lycopene most supplements touted as antioxidants contain at least one of these often as a pure chemical
health chemical and sometimes as a concentrated plant extract since the early s scientists have been putting these compounds through their paces
health paces using double blind randomised controlled trials the gold standard for medical intervention studies time and again however the supplements failed
health failed to pass the test true they knock the wind out of free radicals in a test tube but once inside
health inside the human body they seem strangely powerless not only are they bad at preventing oxidative damage they can even make
health make things worse many scientists are now concluding that at best they are a waste of time and money at worst
health worst they could be harmful the first antioxidant to produce disappointing results was beta carotene once a star among supplements beta
health beta carotene pills were recommended to smokers to protect them against lung cancer this was largely based on the observation made
health made in the s that people who ate a lot of carrots which contain large quantities of beta carotene had some
health some protection against cancer in researchers at the us national cancer institute set about testing beta carotene they recruited more than
health than people at high risk of developing lung cancer either because they smoked or had been exposed to asbestos and gave
health gave around half of them beta carotene supplements the trial was supposed to run for six years but the researchers pulled
health pulled the plug two thirds of the way through after discovering to their surprise and horror that those taking supplements were
health were faring worse than the controls their lung cancer rate was per cent higher and the overall death rate was up
health up per cent it was a shock it not only did no good but had the potential to do harm halliwell
health halliwell says the researchers couldn t be sure that these increases were not caused by chance and beta carotene capsules are
health are still widely sold as an antioxidant further trials though have strengthened the evidence that beta carotene supplements not only fail
health fail to protect people against cancer but can also increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers in may of this
health this year an expert panel convened by the nih concluded that there was no evidence to recommend beta carotene supplements for
health for the general population and strong evidence to recommend that smokers avoid it it s a similar story with the world
health world s most popular antioxidant vitamin e shot to fame in the early s after two large studies involving more than
health than people in total found that those with a diet high in vitamin e were significantly less likely to develop cardiovascular
health cardiovascular disease the first study ed female nurses for eight years it found that the top per cent with respect to
health to vitamin e consumption had a per cent lower incidence of cardiovascular disease than the bottom per cent new england journal
health journal of medicine vol p the second study involving male health professionals found a similar reduction in heart disease risk new
health new england journal of medicine vol p the researchers based at harvard medical school and harvard school of public health even
health even had a plausible mechanism evidence was emerging that one of the causes of heart disease was free radical damage to
health to ldls tiny packages of lipid and protein that circulate in the bloodstream delivering fatty acids to cells it turned out
health out that adding vitamin e to blood samples in the test tube made ldl more resistant to oxidation perhaps this was
health was how vitamin e prevented heart disease at the biochemical level the rationale sounded so good at that time says roland
health roland stocker a biochemist at the university of new south wales in sydney australia use of vitamin e supplements soared in
health in almost nobody took vitamin e by the end of the decade an d million us citizens were knocking back daily
health daily doses on the back of these positive results other researchers set up large studies using vitamin e supplements the results
health results however have been almost universally disappointing only one experiment the cambridge heart antioxidant study chaos found a positive effect a
health a per cent reduced risk of heart attack several others found no protective effect and one even concluded that vitamin e
health e increased the risk of heart failure time for a rethink other trials designed to test whether vitamin e supplements could
health could prevent cancers such as the atbc study in finland also came in negative vitamin e also did not halt the
health the progression to alzheimer s disease in people with mild cognitive impairment what is more when scientists went looking for evidence
health evidence that vitamin e protected ldl against oxidation in the body not just in the test tube they found none except
health except in people with vitamin e deficiency journal of the american medical association vol p in fact despite good evidence that
health that vitamin e is a powerful antioxidant in the test tube there is now serious doubt that it acts the same
health same way in the body vitamin e is not an antioxidant in fact it must be protected against oxidation says angelo
health angelo azzi a biochemist at tufts university in boston massachusetts he points out that vitamin e exists in eight different forms
health forms in nature all of which function as antioxidants in the test tube yet the body only uses one form alpha
health alpha tocopherol which is pulled out of the bloodstream by a highly specialised protein in the liver all the other forms
health forms are excreted azzi argues that evolution is unlikely to have gone to such great lengths simply to obtain an antioxidant
health antioxidant from the diet there are millions of antioxidants he says vitamin e is clearly doing something in the body it
health it is an essential part of the diet and deficiency leads to neurological problems but whatever it s doing it s
health s not an antioxidant there is even some evidence that vitamin e supplements can be harmful last year a team led
health led by edgar miller of the johns hopkins medical institutions in baltimore made headline news when they amalgamated the results of
health of separate trials and concluded that high doses of vitamin e increase overall mortality annals of internal medicine vol p though
health though this conclusion remains controversial it s flawed asserts azzi we re analysed the data and there is no change in
health in mortality most people agree that there is no good evidence that large doses are harmful adds stocker vitamin c is
health is another disappointment people are still trying to defend it but you don t get an effect on free radical damage
health damage unless you start with people with a vitamin c deficiency says halliwell i think it is a lost cause in
health in fact results from a vast us trial probing the links between diet and health called the women s health study
health study suggest that vitamin c supplements may accelerate atherosclerosis in some people with diabetes one class of antioxidants that remains relatively
health relatively unresearched is polyphenols what little evidence there is comes from epidemiological studies some of which suggest that polyphenols prevent disease
health disease and others of which do not while polyphenols act as antioxidants in the test tube it is not clear that
health that they are absorbed into the bloodstream and if they are they are swiftly metabolised for example per cent of a
health a flavonoid called resveratrol the one found in red wine is destroyed by our digestive system before it enters circulation just
health just because a food with a certain compound in it is beneficial to health it does not mean a pill with
health with the same compound in is the conclusion is becoming clear whatever is behind the health benefits of a diet rich
health rich in fruits and vegetables you cannot reproduce it by taking purified extracts or vitamin supplements just because a food with
health with a certain compound in it is beneficial it does not mean a nutraceutical with the same compound in is said
health said paul coates who works in the office of dietary supplements at nih yet the fact remains that people eating diets
health diets abundant in vitamin c vitamin e polyphenols and carotenoids are less likely to suffer heart attacks vascular disease diabetes and
health and cancer one explanation is that these people have a generally healthier lifestyle they exercise more and smoke less for example
health example for now no one knows for sure tough vegetables there are some ideas halliwell still believes that antioxidants are at
health at least partly responsible he argues that because the polyphenols carotenoids and vitamins in fruit and vegetables are bound into tough
health tough fibrous material they hang around in the stomach and colon where they can neutralise free radicals the gastrointestinal tract especially
health especially the stomach with its highly acidic environment is constantly generating reactive oxygen species from food supplements may not replicate this
health this effect because they are digested too quickly andrew shao from the council for responsible nutrition a supplement industry trade association
health association based in washington dc argues along similar lines he says that pulling a nutrient out of context and testing it
health it in a clinical trial is not appropriate antioxidants should not be expected to perform as drugs he insists that s
health s simply not how nutrients work they work in concert with each other there s yet another more intriguing explanation among
health among the leading sources of dietary antioxidants are tea and coffee and there is some evidence that green tea in particular
health particular is linked with health benefits including reduced risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease oddly though halliwell has discovered that tea
health tea and coffee are also bursting with reactive oxygen species in the form of hydrogen peroxide every time you drink a
health a cup of coffee it s a dilute bowl of hydrogen peroxide says halliwell the hydrogen peroxide is there because of
health of the presence of the antioxidants antioxidants is really just another way of saying reducing agent which can react with oxygen
health oxygen in the water to produce hydrogen peroxide think platinum blond and you get the picture of what you might be
health be drinking but if free radicals are bad for us how come coffee and tea might be beneficial one possibility is
health is that they can help nudge our own internal antioxidant systems into action there has been a considerable rethink as to
health to what free radicals are doing says malcolm jackson a biochemist at the university of liverpool uk he believes that in
health in the right quantities radicals can be positively health enhancing prompting our cells to fire up their own internal defence machinery
health machinery a battery of radical busting enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase cells are very good at protecting themselves against
health against minor stresses as long as they are not excessive says jackson the question is should we be quenching free radicals
health radicals at all if it turns out that antioxidants in food work because they generate health promoting quantities of free radicals
health radicals that would be an ironic turnaround it may also explain why supplements and extracts don t seem to work or
health or may even be dangerous the doses are too high and produce too many free radicals for now the advice is

music sounding in succession the notes of a melody are typically created with respect to pitch systems such as scales or modes
music modes harmony is the study of vertical sonorities in music vertical sonority refers to considering the relationships between pitches that occur
music occur together usually this means at the same time although harmony can also be implied by a melody that outlines a

music between music and mind what does musical history reveal to us about the world what is the connection between music and
music and emotions what is meaning in relation to music traditionally the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of
music of rhythmic and harmonic organization in the eighteenth century focus shifted to the experience of hearing music and thus to questions
music questions about its beauty and human enjoyment plaisir and jouissance of music the origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed
music attributed to baumgarten in the th century ed by kant through their writing the ancient term aesthetics meaning sensory perception received
music received its present day connotation in recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment for example music
music music s capacity to express emotion has been a central issue in the th century important contributions were made by peter

news in focus chomsky on iran iraq and the rest of the world commentary chomsky on iran iraq and the rest of
news of the world michael shank february editor john feffer irc foreign policy in focus www fpif org noam chomsky is a
news a noted linguist author and foreign policy expert on february michael shank interviewed him on the latest developments in u s
news s policy toward iran iraq north korea and venezuela along the way chomsky also commented on climate change the world social
news social forum and why international relations are run like the mafia shank with similar nuclear developments in north korea and iran
news iran why has the united states pursued direct diplomacy with north korea but refuses to do so with iran chomsky to
news to say that the united states has pursued diplomacy with north korea is a little bit misleading it did under the
news the clinton administration though neither side completely lived up to their obligations clinton didn t do what was promised nor did
news did north korea but they were making progress so when bush came into the presidency north korea had enough uranium or
news or plutonium for maybe one or two bombs but then very limited missile capacity during the bush years it s exploded
news exploded the reason is he immediately canceled the diplomacy and he s pretty much blocked it ever since they made a
news a very substantial agreement in september in which north korea agreed to eliminate its enrichment programs and nuclear development completely in
news in return the united states agreed to terminate the threats of attack and to begin moving towards the planning for the
news the provision of a light water reactor which had been promised under the framework agreement but the bush administration instantly undermined
news undermined it right away they canceled the international consortium that was planning for the light water reactor which was a way
news way of saying we re not going to agree to this agreement a couple of days later they started attacking the
news the financial transactions of various banks it was timed in such a way to make it clear that the united states
news states was not going to move towards its commitment to improve relations and of course it never withdrew the threats so
news so that was the end of the september agreement that one is now coming back just in the last few days
news days the way it s portrayed in the u s media is as usual with the government s party line that
news that north korea is now perhaps a little more amenable to accept the september proposal so there s some optimism if
news if you go across the atlantic to the financial times to review the same events they point out that an embattled
news embattled bush administration it s their phrase needs some kind of victory so maybe it ll be willing to move towards
news towards diplomacy it s a little more accurate i think if you look at the background but there is some minimal
news minimal sense of optimism about it if you look back over the record mdash and north korea is a horrible place
news place nobody is arguing about that mdash on this issue they ve been pretty rational it s been a kind of
news of tit for tat history if the united states is accommodating the north koreans become accommodating if the united states is
news is hostile they become hostile that s reviewed pretty well by leon sigal who s one of the leading specialists on
news on this in a recent issue of current history but that s been the general picture and we re now at
news at a place where there could be a settlement on north korea that s much less significant for the united states
news states than iran the iranian issue i don t think has much to do with nuclear weapons frankly nobody is saying
news saying iran should have nuclear weapons ndash nor should anybody else but the point in the middle east as distinct from
news from north korea is that this is center of the world s energy resources originally the british and secondarily the french
news french had dominated it but after the second world war it s been a u s preserve that s been an
news an axiom of u s foreign policy that it must control middle east energy resources it is not a matter of
news of access as people often say once the oil is on the seas it goes anywhere in fact if the united
news united states used no middle east oil it d have the same policies if we went on solar energy tomorrow it
news it d keep the same policies just look at the internal record or the logic of it the issue has always
news always been control control is the source of strategic power dick cheney declared in kazakhstan or somewhere that control over pipeline
news pipeline is a ldquo tool of intimidation and blackmail rdquo when we have control over the pipelines it s a tool
news tool of benevolence if other countries have control over the sources of energy and the distribution of energy then it is
news is a tool of intimidation and blackmail exactly as cheney said and that s been understood as far back as george
news george kennan and the early post war days when he pointed out that if the united states controls middle east resources
news resources it ll have veto power over its industrial rivals he was speaking particularly of japan but the point generalizes so
news so iran is a different situation it s part of the major energy system of the world shank so when the
news the united states considers a potential invasion you think it s under the premise of gaining control that is what the
news the united states will gain from attacking iran chomsky there are several issues in the case of iran one is simply
news simply that it is independent and independence is not tolerated sometimes it s called successful defiance in the internal record take
news take cuba a very large majority of the u s population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with cuba and
news and has been for a long time with some fluctuations and even part of the business world is in favor of
news of it too but the government won t allow it it s attributed to the florida vote but i don t
news t think that s much of an explanation i think it has to do with a feature of world affairs that
news that is insufficiently appreciated international affairs is very much run like the mafia the godfather does not accept disobedience even from
news from a small storekeeper who doesn t pay his protection money you have to have obedience otherwise the idea can spread
news spread that you don t have to listen to the orders and it can spread to important places if you look
news look back at the record what was the main reason for the u s attack on vietnam independent development can be
news be a virus that can infect others that s the way it s been put kissinger in this case referring to
news to allende in chile and with cuba it s explicit in the internal record arthur schlesinger presenting the report of the
news the latin american study group to incoming president kennedy wrote that the danger is the spread of the castro idea of
news of taking matters into your own hands which has a lot of appeal to others in the same region that suffer
news suffer from the same problems later internal documents charged cuba with successful defiance of u s policies going back years ndash
news ndash to the monroe doctrine and that can t be tolerated so there s kind of a state commitment to ensuring
news ensuring obedience going back to iran it s not only that it has substantial resources and that it s part of
news of the world s major energy system but it also defied the united states the united states as we know overthrew
news overthrew the parliamentary government installed a brutal tyrant was helping him develop nuclear power in fact the very same programs that
news that are now considered a threat were being sponsored by the u s government by cheney wolfowitz kissinger and others in
news in the s as long as the shah was in power but then the iranians overthrew him and they kept u
news u s hostages for several hundred days and the united states immediately turned to supporting saddam hussein and his war against
news against iran as a way of punishing iran the united states is going to continue to punish iran because of its
news its defiance so that s a separate factor and again the will of the u s population and even us business
news business is considered mostly irrelevant seventy five percent of the population here favors improving relations with iran instead of threats but
news but this is disregarded we don t have polls from the business world but it s pretty clear that the energy
news energy corporations would be quite happy to be given authorization to go back into iran instead of leaving all that to
news to their rivals but the state won t allow it and it is setting up confrontations right now very explicitly part
news part of the reason is strategic geo political economic but part of the reason is the mafia complex they have to
news to be punished for disobeying us shank venezuela has been successfully defiant with chavez making a swing towards socialism where are
news are they on our list chomsky they re very high the united states sponsored and supported a military coup to overthrow
news overthrow the government in fact that s its last most recent effort in what used to be a conventional resort to
news to such measures shank but why haven t we turned our sights more toward venezuela chomsky oh they re there there
news there s a constant stream of abuse and attack by the government and therefore the media who are almost reflexively against
news against venezuela for several reasons venezuela is independent it s diversifying its exports to a limited extent instead of just being
news being dependent on exports to the united states and it s initiating moves toward latin american integration and independence it s
news s what they call a bolivarian alternative and the united states doesn t like any of that this again is defiance
news defiance of u s policies going back to the monroe doctrine there s now a standard interpretation of this trend in
news in latin america another kind of party line latin america is all moving to the left from venezuela to argentina with
news with rare exceptions but there s a good left and a bad left the good left is garcia and lula and
news and then there s the bad left which is chavez morales maybe correa and that s the split in order to
news to maintain that position it s necessary to resort to some fancy footwork for example it s necessary not to report
news report the fact that when lula was re elected in october his foreign trip and one of his first acts was
news was to visit caracas to support chavez and his electoral campaign and to dedicate a joint venezuelan brazilian project on the
news the orinoco river to talk about new projects and so on it s necessary not to report the fact that a
news a couple of weeks later in cochabamba bolivia which is the heart of the bad guys there was a meeting of
news of all south american leaders there had been bad blood between chavez and garcia but it was apparently patched up they
news they laid plans for pretty constructive south american integration but that just doesn t fit the u s agenda so it
news it wasn t reported shank how is the political deadlock in lebanon impacting the u s government s decision to potentially
news potentially go to war with iran is there a relationship at all chomsky there s a relationship i presume part of
news of the reason for the u s israel invasion of lebanon in july mdash and it is us israeli the lebanese
news lebanese are correct in calling it that mdash part of the reason i suppose was that hezbollah is considered a deterrent
news deterrent to a potential u s israeli attack on iran it had a deterrent capacity i e rockets and the goal
news goal i presume was to wipe out the deterrent so as to free up the united states and israel for an
news an eventual attack on iran that s at least part of the reason the official reason given for the invasion can
news can t be taken seriously for a moment that s the capture of two israeli soldiers and the killing of a
news a couple others for decades israel has been capturing and kidnapping lebanese and palestinian refugees on the high seas from cyprus
news cyprus to lebanon killing them in lebanon bringing them to israel holding them as hostages it s been going on for
news for decades has anybody called for an invasion of israel of course israel doesn t want any competition in the region
news region but there s no principled basis for the massive attack on lebanon which was horrendous in fact one of the
news the last acts of the u s israeli invasion right after the ceasefire was announced before it was implemented was to
news to saturate much of the south with cluster bombs there s no military purpose for that the war was over the
news the ceasefire was coming un de mining groups that are working there say that the scale is unprecedented it s much
news much worse than any other place they ve worked kosovo afghanistan iraq anywhere there are supposed to be about one million
news million bomblets left there a large percentage of them don t explode until you pick them up a child picks them
news them up or a farmer hits it with a hoe or something so what it does basically is make the south
news south uninhabitable until the mining teams for which the united states and israel don t contribute clean it up this is
news is arable land it means that farmers can t go back it means that it may undermine a potential hezbollah deterrent
news deterrent they apparently have pretty much withdrawn from the south according to the un you can t mention hezbollah in the
news the u s media without putting in the context of ldquo iranian supported hezbollah rdquo that s its name its name
news name is iranian supported hezbollah it gets iranian support but you can mention israel without saying us supported israel so this
news this is more tacit propaganda the idea that hezbollah is acting as an agent of iran is very dubious it s
news s not accepted by specialists on iran or specialists on hezbollah but it s the party line or sometimes you can
news can put in syria i e ldquo syrian supported hezbollah rdquo but since syria is of less interest now you have
news have to emphasize iranian support shank how can the u s government think an attack on iran is feasible given troop
news troop availability troop capacity and public sentiment chomsky as far as i m aware the military in the united states thinks
news thinks it s crazy and from whatever leaks we have from intelligence the intelligence community thinks it s outlandish but not
news not impossible if you look at people who have really been involved in the pentagon s strategic planning for years people
news people like sam gardiner they point out that there are things that possibly could be done i don t think any
news any of the outside commentators at least as far as i m aware have taken very seriously the idea of bombing
news bombing nuclear facilities they say if there will be bombing it ll be carpet bombing so get the nuclear facilities but
news but get the rest of the country too with an exception by accident of geography the world s major oil resources
news resources are in shi ite dominated areas iran s oil is concentrated right near the gulf which happens to be an
news an arab area not persian khuzestan is arab has been loyal to iran fought with iran not iraq during the iran
news iran iraq war this is a potential source of dissension i would be amazed if there isn t an attempt going
news going on to stir up secessionist elements in khuzestan u s forces right across the border in iraq including the surge
news surge are available potentially to ldquo defend rdquo an independent khuzestan against iran which is the way it would be put
news put if they can carry it off shank do you think that s what the surge was for chomsky that s
news s one possibility there was a release of a pentagon war gaming report in december with gardiner leading it it was
news was released and published in the atlantic ly they couldn t come up with a proposal that didn t lead to
news to disaster but one of the things they considered was maintaining troop presence in iraq beyond what s to be used
news used in iraq for troop replacement and so on and use them for a potential land move in iran presumably khuzestan
news khuzestan where the oil is if you could carry that off you could just bomb the rest of the country to
news to dust again i would be amazed if there aren t efforts to sponsor secessionist movements elsewhere among the azeri population
news population for example it s a very complex ethnic mix in iran much of the population isn t persian there are
news are secessionist tendencies anyway and almost certainly without knowing any of the facts the united states is trying to stir them
news them up to break the country internally if possible the strategy appears to be try to break the country up internally
news internally try to impel the leadership to be as harsh and brutal as possible that s the immediate consequence of constant
news constant threats everyone knows that that s one of the reasons the reformists shirin ebadi and akbar ganji and others are
news are bitterly complaining about the u s threats that it s undermining their efforts to reform and democratize iran but that
news that s presumably its purpose since it s an obvious consequence you have to assume it s the purpose just like
news like in law anticipated consequences are taken as the evidence for intention and here s it so obvious you can t
news t seriously doubt it so it could be that one strain of the policy is to stir up secessionist movements particularly
news particularly in the oil rich regions the arab regions near the gulf also the azeri regions and others second is to
news to try to get the leadership to be as brutal and harsh and repressive as possible to stir up internal disorder
news disorder and maybe resistance and a third is to try to pressure other countries and europe is the most amenable to
news to join efforts to strangle iran economically europe is kind of dragging its feet but they usually go along with the
news the united states the efforts to intensify the harshness of the regime show up in many ways for example the west
news west absolutely adores ahmadinejad any wild statement that he comes out with immediately gets circulated in headlines and mistranslated they love
news love him but anybody who knows anything about iran presumably the editorial offices knows that he doesn t have anything to
news to do with foreign policy foreign policy is in the hands of his superior the supreme leader khamenei but they don
news don t report his statements particularly when his statements are pretty conciliatory for example they love when ahmadinejad says that israel
news israel shouldn t exist but they don t like it when khamenei right afterwards says that iran supports the arab league
news league position on israel palestine as far as i m aware it never got reported actually you could find khamenei s
news s more conciliatory positions in the financial times but not here and it s repeated by iranian diplomats but that s
news s no good the arab league proposal calls for normalization of relations with israel if it accepts the international consensus of
news of the two state settlement which has been blocked by the united states and israel for thirty years and that s
news s not a good story so it s either not mentioned or it s hidden somewhere it s very hard to
news to predict the bush administration today because they re deeply irrational they were irrational to start with but now they re
news re desperate they have created an unimaginable catastrophe in iraq this should ve been one of the easiest military occupations in
news in history and they succeeded in turning it into one of the worst military disasters in history they can t control
news control it and it s almost impossible for them to get out for reasons you can t discuss in the united
news united states because to discuss the reasons why they can t get out would be to concede the reasons why they
news they invaded we re supposed to believe that oil had nothing to do with it that if iraq were exporting pickles
news pickles or jelly and the center of world oil production were in the south pacific that the united states would ve
news ve liberated them anyway it has nothing to do with the oil what a crass idea anyone with their head screwed
news screwed on knows that that can t be true allowing an independent and sovereign iraq could be a nightmare for the
news the united states it would mean that it would be shi ite dominated at least if it s minimally democratic it
news it would continue to improve relations with iran just what the united states doesn t want to see and beyond that
news that right across the border in saudi arabia where most of saudi oil is there happens to be a large shi
news shi ite population probably a majority moves toward sovereignty in iraq stimulate pressures first for human rights among the bitterly repressed
news repressed shi ite population but also toward some degree of autonomy you can imagine a kind of a loose shi ite
news ite alliance in iraq saudi arabia and iran controlling most of the world s oil and independent of the united states
news states and much worse although europe can be intimidated by the united states china can t it s one of the
news the reasons the main reasons why china is considered a threat we re back to the mafia principle china has been
news been there for years has contempt for the barbarians is overcoming a century of domination and simply moves on its own
news own it does not get intimidated when uncle sam shakes his fist that s scary in particular it s dangerous in
news in the case of the middle east china is the center of the asian energy security grid which includes the central
news central asian states and russia india is also hovering around the edge south korea is involved and iran is an associate
news associate member of some kind if the middle east oil resources around the gulf which are the main ones in the
news the world if they link up to the asian grid the united states is really a second rate power a lot
news lot is at stake in not withdrawing from iraq i m sure that these issues are discussed in internal planning it
news it s inconceivable that they can t think of this but it s out of public discussion it s not in
news in the media it s not in the journals it s not in the baker hamilton report and i think you
news you can understand the reason to bring up these issues would open the question why the united states and britain invaded
news invaded and that question is taboo it s a principle that anything our leaders do is for noble reasons it may
news may be mistaken it may be ugly but basically noble and if you bring in normal moderate conservative strategic economic objectives
news objectives you threatening that principle it s remarkable the extent to which it s held so the original pretexts for the
news the invasion were weapons of mass destruction and ties to al qaida that nobody but maybe wolfowitz or cheney took seriously
news seriously the single question as they kept reiterating in the leadership was will saddam give up his programs of weapons of
news of mass destruction the single question was answered a couple of s later the wrong way and quickly the party line
news line shifted in november bush announced his freedom agenda our real goal is to bring democracy to iraq to transform the
news the middle east that became the party line instantly but it s a mistake to pick out individuals because it s
news s close to universal even in scholarship in fact you can even find scholarly articles that begin by giving the evidence
news evidence that it s complete farce but nevertheless accept it there was a pretty good study of the freedom agenda in
news in current history by two scholars and they give the facts they point out that the freedom agenda was announced on
news on november after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction but the freedom agenda is real even if there s
news s no evidence for it in fact if you look at our policies they re the opposite take palestine there was
news was a free election in palestine but it came out the wrong way so instantly the united states and israel with
news with europe tagging along moved to punish the palestinian people and punish them harshly because they voted the wrong way in
news in a free election that s accepted here in the west as perfectly normal that illustrates the deep hatred and contempt
news contempt for democracy among western elites so deep seated they can t even perceive it when it s in front of
news of their eyes you punish people severely if they vote the wrong way in a free election there s a pretext
news pretext for that too repeated every day hamas must agree to first recognize israel second to end all violence third to
news to accept past agreements try to find a mention of the fact that the united states and israel reject all three
news three of those they obviously don t recognize palestine they certainly don t withdraw the use of violence or the threat
news threat of it in fact they insist on it and they don t accept past agreements including the road map i
news i suspect one of the reasons why jimmy carter s book has come under such fierce attack is because it s
news s the first time i think in the mainstream that one can find the truth about the road map i have
news have never seen anything in the mainstream that discusses the fact that israel instantly rejected the road map with u s
news s support they formally accepted it but added reservations that totally eviscerated it it was done instantly it s public knowledge
news knowledge i ve about it talked about it so have others but i ve never seen it mentioned in the mainstream
news mainstream before and obviously they don t accept the arab league proposal or any other serious proposal in fact they ve
news ve been blocking the international consensus on the two state solution for decades but hamas has to accept them it really
news really makes no sense hamas is a political party and political parties don t recognize other countries and hamas itself has
news has made it very clear they actually carried out a truce for a year and a half didn t respond to
news to israeli attacks and have called for a long term truce during which it d be possible to negotiate a settlement
news settlement along the lines of the international consensus and the arab league proposal all of this is obvious it s right
news right on the surface and that s just one example of the deep hatred of democracy on the part of western
news western elites it s a striking example but you can add case after case yet the president announced the freedom agenda
news agenda and if the dear leader said something it s got to be true kind of north korean style therefore there
news there s a freedom agenda even if there s a mountain of evidence against it the only evidence for it is
news is in words even apart from the timing shank in the presidential election how will the candidates approach iran do you
news you think iran will be a deciding factor in the elections chomsky what they re saying so far is not encouraging
news encouraging i still think despite everything that the us is very unlikely to attack iran it could be a huge catastrophe
news catastrophe nobody knows what the consequences would be i imagine that only an administration that s really desperate would resort to
news to that but if the democratic candidates are on the verge of winning the election the administration is going to be
news be desperate it still has the problem of iraq can t stay in and can t get out shank the senate
news senate democrats can t seem to achieve consensus on this issue chomsky i think there s a reason for it the
news the reason is just thinking through the consequences of allowing an independent partially democratic iraq the consequences are nontrivial we may
news may decide to hide our heads in the sand and pretend we can t think it through because we cannot allow
news allow the question of why the united states invaded to open but that s very self destructive shank is there any
news any connection to this conversation and why we cannot find the political will and momentum to enact legislation that would reduce
news reduce c emissions levels institute a cap and trade system etc chomsky it s perfectly clear why the united states didn
news didn t sign the kyoto protocol again there s overwhelming popular support for signing in fact it s so strong that
news that a majority of bush voters in thought that he was in favor of the kyoto protocol it s such an
news an obvious thing to support popular support for alternative energy has been very high for years but it harms corporate profits
news profits after all that s the administration s constituency i remember talking to years ago one of the leading people in
news in the government who was involved in arms control pressing for arms control measures d eacute tente and so on he
news he s very high up and we were talking about whether arms control could succeed and only partially as a joke
news joke he said ldquo well it might succeed if the high tech industry makes more profit from arms control than it
news it can make from weapons related research and production if we get to that tipping point maybe arms control will work
news work rdquo he was partially joking but there s a truth that lies behind it shank how do we move forward
news forward on climate change without beggaring the south chomsky unfortunately the poor countries the south are going to suffer the worst
news worst according to most projections mdash and that being so it undermines support in the north for doing much look at
news at the ozone story as long as it was the southern hemisphere that was being threatened there was very little talk
news talk about it when it was discovered in the north very quickly actions were taken to do something about it right
news right now there s discussion of putting serious effort into developing a malaria vaccine because global warming might extend malaria to
news to the rich countries so something should be done about it same thing on health insurance here s an issue where
news where for the general population it s been the leading domestic issue or close to it for years and there s
news s a consensus for a national healthcare system on the model of other industrial countries maybe expanding medicare to everyone or
news or something like that well that s off the agenda nobody can talk about that the insurance companies don t like
news like it the financial industry doesn t like and so on now there s a change taking place what s happening
news happening is that manufacturing industries are beginning to turn to support for it because they re being undermined by the hopelessly
news hopelessly inefficient u s healthcare system it s the worst in the industrial world by far and they have to pay
news pay for it since it s employer compensated in part their production costs are much higher than those competitors who have
news have a national healthcare system take gm if it produces the same car in detroit and in windsor across the border
news border in canada it saves i forget the number i think over with the windsor production because there s a national
news national healthcare system it s much more efficient it s much cheaper it s much more effective so the manufacturing industry
news industry is starting to press for some kind of national healthcare now it s beginning to put it on the agenda
news agenda it doesn t matter if the population wants it what of the population wants would be kind of irrelevant but
news but if part of the concentration of corporate capital that basically runs the country another thing we re not allowed to
news to say but it s obvious if part of that sector becomes in favor then the issue moves onto the political

news countries have been shamefully the major client states and will bend over backward to please their master i wonder what it
news it will take to wake up the american public to the fact that their leaders and elites despise democracy if at
news at all such a phenomenon really exists in its entire sense name john anderson date feb go to asian times website
news website where a letter writer chomsky apart name art costa date feb first i want to thank you for yet another
news another insightful discussion with noam chomsky i don t think american imperialism is a neocon invention probably it s zenith is

news american hemisphere that said i think our foreign policy has shaped our democracy such as it is it was born from
news from progressive documents us constitution bill of rights and the declaration of independence but is pre and post dated through countless
news countless wars of expansionism first in the us and then abroad and continues to this day the arrogance of power or
news or specifically imperialistic interventionism and as chomsky aptly characterizes it as the mafia principle is inherent in a uni polar world
news world whether we talk about darfur or afganistan or iraq we are always honing in on a role of intervention in
news in essentially all of these situations the context is from one perspective american western hegemony we rarely truly understand the complexity
news complexity the history and the nuances of nations such as darfur or rwanda and most certainly iraq occasionally we see horrible
news horrible conflict and want to stop it and through military inteversion we exchange their horror for the one we perpetrate through
news through our force more frequently it is pure unadulterated control of a region and its resources or purposes of pure arrogance

news conflict war has always begotten war regardless of intentions until we understand and act on it professor chomsky will always have
news have sufficient material for his interviews and essays name alexander syrus date feb mr andersron s reference to a letter in

news somewhere in between either it s about historical facts that depict the sufferings of millions of people americans included to further
news further inform you and as a multilingual person i would like to add that the language that one speaks shapes the
news the way that one thinks so it should not be surprising that chomsky being a linguist has a much deeper understanding
news understanding of the kind of thinking that makes up irrational and dangerous policies which when implemented only make the world much

news week on a recent widely reported international monetary fund study on inequality the imf found as had other recent researchers that
news that countries with lower levels of economic inequality showed higher levels of long term economic growth krugman focused on the fact
news fact that this disproved the famous thesis of economist arthur okun expressed succinctly in the title of his succinct masterpiece equality
news equality and efficiency the big trade off okun was a liberal adviser to lyndon johnson but his argument essentially that economic
news economic redistribution to reduce inequality necessarily introduces economic inefficiency is now essentially the central intellectual argument of conservatism it s clear
news clear why krugman would want to repudiate it and see that repudiation in the new data what krugman doesn t plumb
news plumb in trumpeting the imf findings is why they should be so okun s thesis after all is almost a tautology
news tautology in classical economics deviations from what an efficient market would yield are by definition inefficient therefore redistribution after the fact
news fact is by definition inefficient of course the biggest problem with classical economics is that efficient markets exist more in theory
news theory than in the real world one real world inefficiency is the starting distribution of economic goods such as wealth which
news which has little to do with talent or merit or with needs such as innate health conditions as a result redistribution
news redistribution could actually improve real world macro efficiency just not micro efficiency as defined by micro economics see a collection of
news of political cartoons on the economy for that reason pursing such efficiency probably has much to do with making an economy
news economy less productive in the long run classical definitions of efficiency aspire to an objective definition of value so that spending
news spending million to save bill gates life is worth it simply because gates is willing to spend the million while spending
news spending the same amount to save a poor individual is not because well what poor person is going to spend million
news million on medical care of course some would argue that gates is worth spending million to save for the same reason
news reason he has the million to spend he s a successful maker whereas the poor person is a proven loser this
news this basically assumes though that the contribution all individuals can make to future economic growth is directly related to their monetary
news monetary resources at present this is contradicted by the vast number of creators from entrepreneurs to scientists who start in poverty
news poverty are in fact often driven to succeed by their humble origins and who form what evidence there is for the
news the conservative position that making it tough on the poor is good for them because it incentivizes achievement and that brings
news brings us closer to an explanation for the results krugman cites giving more people a shot at economic success produces greater
news greater gains for society because more people are contributing this is hardly startling news the world bank study of the arab
news arab world a few years back concluded that the major reason why arab countries languish economically is because their exclusion of
news of women from the economic mainstream eliminates half the population s possible contribution to growth from the get go for the
news the same reason many development efforts in sub saharan africa now focus on getting education for more young girls this isn
news isn t just a gender issue any systematic exclusion of large percentages of the population from the instruments of success particularly
news particularly education hobbles an entire society a good deal of america s prowess is due to the historical fact that more
news more or less anyone could make it here not just the aristocracy not just those of anglo saxon extraction and that
news that s in large part because more or less everyone was invested with an education thanks to a national commitment that
news that might be attacked today as socialist except that it dates back to the founding congress see a collection of political
news political cartoons on congress the fact that bringing in more outsiders benefits not just those outsiders themselves but also those already

news lack of access to networks the defining characteristic of networks is that everyone gains from others joining the network phones faxes
news faxes the internet all are more valuable to you the more others are connected to them so it s not hard
news hard to see how reducing inequality at least in terms of access to opportunities and resources leads to greater growth for
news for society as a whole my argument has been that lack of success not lack of money per se is what
news what defines and keeps people in poverty last week i was part of a panel at the atlantic s conference on
news on reinventing the war on poverty krugman appeared via video immediately after our panel angela glover blackwell founder and president of

news may help in the short term but the real solution is to build bridges the benefits to the larger society of

news economic spurts it s good to recall that we re talking correlations not cause and effect while we ve got an

news large scale attempt at making left anarchism workable without such excesses are mass murder uh are you sure you want to
news to go down that route i mean all i was trying to point out was that the spanish civil war featured
news featured just a few more participants than left libertarians i really didn t expect a goddamn libertarian to try and use
news use the existing socialism gambit i mean your track record is no better and your own rhetoric explains the reason libertarian
news libertarian movements tend to be put down with bullets batons and gas wielded by authoritarians of both public and private types
news types grokked feb th at am i can grok the stereotype i have met him in the flesh yet libertarians themselves
news themselves civil rights abuses check big government with special favors for the powerful check if liberals really were liberal you know
news know like libertarians who actually are social and economic liberals foreign policy in focus www fpif org noam chomsky is a
news a noted linguist author and foreign policy expert on february michael shank interviewed him on the latest developments in u s
news s policy toward iran iraq north korea and venezuela along the way chomsky also commented on climate change the world social
news social forum and why international relations are run like the mafia shank with similar nuclear developments in north korea and iran
news iran why has the united states pursued direct diplomacy with north korea but refuses to do so with iran chomsky to
news to say that the united states has pursued diplomacy with north korea is a little bit misleading it did under the
news the clinton administration though neither side completely lived up to their obligations clinton didn t do what was promised nor did
news did north korea but they were making progress so when bush came into the presidency north korea had enough uranium or
news or plutonium for maybe one or two bombs but then very limited missile capacity during the bush years it s exploded
news exploded the reason is he immediately canceled the diplomacy and he s pretty much blocked it ever since they made a
news a very substantial agreement in september in which north korea agreed to eliminate its enrichment programs and nuclear development completely in
news in return the united states agreed to terminate the threats of attack and to begin moving towards the planning for the
news the provision of a light water reactor which had been promised under the framework agreement but the bush administration instantly undermined
news undermined it right away they canceled the international consortium that was planning for the light water reactor which was a way
news way of saying we re not going to agree to this agreement a couple of days later they started attacking the
news the financial transactions of various banks it was timed in such a way to make it clear that the united states
news states was not going to move towards its commitment to improve relations and of course it never withdrew the threats so
news so that was the end of the september agreement that one is now coming back just in the last few days
news days the way it s portrayed in the u s media is as usual with the government s party line that
news that north korea is now perhaps a little more amenable to accept the september proposal so there s some optimism if
news if you go across the atlantic to the financial times to review the same events they point out that an embattled
news embattled bush administration it s their phrase needs some kind of victory so maybe it ll be willing to move towards
news towards diplomacy it s a little more accurate i think if you look at the background but there is some minimal
news minimal sense of optimism about it if you look back over the record mdash and north korea is a horrible place
news place nobody is arguing about that mdash on this issue they ve been pretty rational it s been a kind of
news of tit for tat history if the united states is accommodating the north koreans become accommodating if the united states is
news is hostile they become hostile that s reviewed pretty well by leon sigal who s one of the leading specialists on
news on this in a recent issue of current history but that s been the general picture and we re now at
news at a place where there could be a settlement on north korea that s much less significant for the united states
news states than iran the iranian issue i don t think has much to do with nuclear weapons frankly nobody is saying
news saying iran should have nuclear weapons ndash nor should anybody else but the point in the middle east as distinct from
news from north korea is that this is center of the world s energy resources originally the british and secondarily the french
news french had dominated it but after the second world war it s been a u s preserve that s been an
news an axiom of u s foreign policy that it must control middle east energy resources it is not a matter of
news of access as people often say once the oil is on the seas it goes anywhere in fact if the united
news united states used no middle east oil it d have the same policies if we went on solar energy tomorrow it
news it d keep the same policies just look at the internal record or the logic of it the issue has always
news always been control control is the source of strategic power dick cheney declared in kazakhstan or somewhere that control over pipeline
news pipeline is a ldquo tool of intimidation and blackmail rdquo when we have control over the pipelines it s a tool
news tool of benevolence if other countries have control over the sources of energy and the distribution of energy then it is
news is a tool of intimidation and blackmail exactly as cheney said and that s been understood as far back as george
news george kennan and the early post war days when he pointed out that if the united states controls middle east resources
news resources it ll have veto power over its industrial rivals he was speaking particularly of japan but the point generalizes so
news so iran is a different situation it s part of the major energy system of the world shank so when the
news the united states considers a potential invasion you think it s under the premise of gaining control that is what the
news the united states will gain from attacking iran chomsky there are several issues in the case of iran one is simply
news simply that it is independent and independence is not tolerated sometimes it s called successful defiance in the internal record take
news take cuba a very large majority of the u s population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with cuba and
news and has been for a long time with some fluctuations and even part of the business world is in favor of
news of it too but the government won t allow it it s attributed to the florida vote but i don t
news t think that s much of an explanation i think it has to do with a feature of world affairs that
news that is insufficiently appreciated international affairs is very much run like the mafia the godfather does not accept disobedience even from
news from a small storekeeper who doesn t pay his protection money you have to have obedience otherwise the idea can spread
news spread that you don t have to listen to the orders and it can spread to important places if you look
news look back at the record what was the main reason for the u s attack on vietnam independent development can be
news be a virus that can infect others that s the way it s been put kissinger in this case referring to
news to allende in chile and with cuba it s explicit in the internal record arthur schlesinger presenting the report of the
news the latin american study group to incoming president kennedy wrote that the danger is the spread of the castro idea of
news of taking matters into your own hands which has a lot of appeal to others in the same region that suffer
news suffer from the same problems later internal documents charged cuba with successful defiance of u s policies going back years ndash
news ndash to the monroe doctrine and that can t be tolerated so there s kind of a state commitment to ensuring
news ensuring obedience going back to iran it s not only that it has substantial resources and that it s part of
news of the world s major energy system but it also defied the united states the united states as we know overthrew
news overthrew the parliamentary government installed a brutal tyrant was helping him develop nuclear power in fact the very same programs that
news that are now considered a threat were being sponsored by the u s government by cheney wolfowitz kissinger and others in
news in the s as long as the shah was in power but then the iranians overthrew him and they kept u
news u s hostages for several hundred days and the united states immediately turned to supporting saddam hussein and his war against
news against iran as a way of punishing iran the united states is going to continue to punish iran because of its
news its defiance so that s a separate factor and again the will of the u s population and even us business
news business is considered mostly irrelevant seventy five percent of the population here favors improving relations with iran instead of threats but
news but this is disregarded we don t have polls from the business world but it s pretty clear that the energy
news energy corporations would be quite happy to be given authorization to go back into iran instead of leaving all that to
news to their rivals but the state won t allow it and it is setting up confrontations right now very explicitly part
news part of the reason is strategic geo political economic but part of the reason is the mafia complex they have to
news to be punished for disobeying us shank venezuela has been successfully defiant with chavez making a swing towards socialism where are
news are they on our list chomsky they re very high the united states sponsored and supported a military coup to overthrow
news overthrow the government in fact that s its last most recent effort in what used to be a conventional resort to
news to such measures shank but why haven t we turned our sights more toward venezuela chomsky oh they re there there
news there s a constant stream of abuse and attack by the government and therefore the media who are almost reflexively against
news against venezuela for several reasons venezuela is independent it s diversifying its exports to a limited extent instead of just being
news being dependent on exports to the united states and it s initiating moves toward latin american integration and independence it s
news s what they call a bolivarian alternative and the united states doesn t like any of that this again is defiance
news defiance of u s policies going back to the monroe doctrine there s now a standard interpretation of this trend in
news in latin america another kind of party line latin america is all moving to the left from venezuela to argentina with
news with rare exceptions but there s a good left and a bad left the good left is garcia and lula and
news and then there s the bad left which is chavez morales maybe correa and that s the split in order to
news to maintain that position it s necessary to resort to some fancy footwork for example it s necessary not to report
news report the fact that when lula was re elected in october his foreign trip and one of his first acts was
news was to visit caracas to support chavez and his electoral campaign and to dedicate a joint venezuelan brazilian project on the
news the orinoco river to talk about new projects and so on it s necessary not to report the fact that a
news a couple of weeks later in cochabamba bolivia which is the heart of the bad guys there was a meeting of
news of all south american leaders there had been bad blood between chavez and garcia but it was apparently patched up they
news they laid plans for pretty constructive south american integration but that just doesn t fit the u s agenda so it
news it wasn t reported shank how is the political deadlock in lebanon impacting the u s government s decision to potentially
news potentially go to war with iran is there a relationship at all chomsky there s a relationship i presume part of
news of the reason for the u s israel invasion of lebanon in july mdash and it is us israeli the lebanese
news lebanese are correct in calling it that mdash part of the reason i suppose was that hezbollah is considered a deterrent
news deterrent to a potential u s israeli attack on iran it had a deterrent capacity i e rockets and the goal
news goal i presume was to wipe out the deterrent so as to free up the united states and israel for an
news an eventual attack on iran that s at least part of the reason the official reason given for the invasion can
news can t be taken seriously for a moment that s the capture of two israeli soldiers and the killing of a
news a couple others for decades israel has been capturing and kidnapping lebanese and palestinian refugees on the high seas from cyprus
news cyprus to lebanon killing them in lebanon bringing them to israel holding them as hostages it s been going on for
news for decades has anybody called for an invasion of israel of course israel doesn t want any competition in the region
news region but there s no principled basis for the massive attack on lebanon which was horrendous in fact one of the
news the last acts of the u s israeli invasion right after the ceasefire was announced before it was implemented was to
news to saturate much of the south with cluster bombs there s no military purpose for that the war was over the
news the ceasefire was coming un de mining groups that are working there say that the scale is unprecedented it s much
news much worse than any other place they ve worked kosovo afghanistan iraq anywhere there are supposed to be about one million
news million bomblets left there a large percentage of them don t explode until you pick them up a child picks them
news them up or a farmer hits it with a hoe or something so what it does basically is make the south
news south uninhabitable until the mining teams for which the united states and israel don t contribute clean it up this is
news is arable land it means that farmers can t go back it means that it may undermine a potential hezbollah deterrent
news deterrent they apparently have pretty much withdrawn from the south according to the un you can t mention hezbollah in the
news the u s media without putting in the context of ldquo iranian supported hezbollah rdquo that s its name its name
news name is iranian supported hezbollah it gets iranian support but you can mention israel without saying us supported israel so this
news this is more tacit propaganda the idea that hezbollah is acting as an agent of iran is very dubious it s
news s not accepted by specialists on iran or specialists on hezbollah but it s the party line or sometimes you can
news can put in syria i e ldquo syrian supported hezbollah rdquo but since syria is of less interest now you have
news have to emphasize iranian support shank how can the u s government think an attack on iran is feasible given troop
news troop availability troop capacity and public sentiment chomsky as far as i m aware the military in the united states thinks
news thinks it s crazy and from whatever leaks we have from intelligence the intelligence community thinks it s outlandish but not
news not impossible if you look at people who have really been involved in the pentagon s strategic planning for years people
news people like sam gardiner they point out that there are things that possibly could be done i don t think any
news any of the outside commentators at least as far as i m aware have taken very seriously the idea of bombing
news bombing nuclear facilities they say if there will be bombing it ll be carpet bombing so get the nuclear facilities but
news but get the rest of the country too with an exception by accident of geography the world s major oil resources
news resources are in shi ite dominated areas iran s oil is concentrated right near the gulf which happens to be an
news an arab area not persian khuzestan is arab has been loyal to iran fought with iran not iraq during the iran
news iran iraq war this is a potential source of dissension i would be amazed if there isn t an attempt going
news going on to stir up secessionist elements in khuzestan u s forces right across the border in iraq including the surge
news surge are available potentially to ldquo defend rdquo an independent khuzestan against iran which is the way it would be put
news put if they can carry it off shank do you think that s what the surge was for chomsky that s
news s one possibility there was a release of a pentagon war gaming report in december with gardiner leading it it was
news was released and published in the atlantic ly they couldn t come up with a proposal that didn t lead to
news to disaster but one of the things they considered was maintaining troop presence in iraq beyond what s to be used
news used in iraq for troop replacement and so on and use them for a potential land move in iran presumably khuzestan
news khuzestan where the oil is if you could carry that off you could just bomb the rest of the country to
news to dust again i would be amazed if there aren t efforts to sponsor secessionist movements elsewhere among the azeri population
news population for example it s a very complex ethnic mix in iran much of the population isn t persian there are
news are secessionist tendencies anyway and almost certainly without knowing any of the facts the united states is trying to stir them
news them up to break the country internally if possible the strategy appears to be try to break the country up internally
news internally try to impel the leadership to be as harsh and brutal as possible that s the immediate consequence of constant
news constant threats everyone knows that that s one of the reasons the reformists shirin ebadi and akbar ganji and others are
news are bitterly complaining about the u s threats that it s undermining their efforts to reform and democratize iran but that
news that s presumably its purpose since it s an obvious consequence you have to assume it s the purpose just like
news like in law anticipated consequences are taken as the evidence for intention and here s it so obvious you can t
news t seriously doubt it so it could be that one strain of the policy is to stir up secessionist movements particularly
news particularly in the oil rich regions the arab regions near the gulf also the azeri regions and others second is to
news to try to get the leadership to be as brutal and harsh and repressive as possible to stir up internal disorder
news disorder and maybe resistance and a third is to try to pressure other countries and europe is the most amenable to
news to join efforts to strangle iran economically europe is kind of dragging its feet but they usually go along with the
news the united states the efforts to intensify the harshness of the regime show up in many ways for example the west
news west absolutely adores ahmadinejad any wild statement that he comes out with immediately gets circulated in headlines and mistranslated they love
news love him but anybody who knows anything about iran presumably the editorial offices knows that he doesn t have anything to
news to do with foreign policy foreign policy is in the hands of his superior the supreme leader khamenei but they don
news don t report his statements particularly when his statements are pretty conciliatory for example they love when ahmadinejad says that israel
news israel shouldn t exist but they don t like it when khamenei right afterwards says that iran supports the arab league
news league position on israel palestine as far as i m aware it never got reported actually you could find khamenei s
news s more conciliatory positions in the financial times but not here and it s repeated by iranian diplomats but that s
news s no good the arab league proposal calls for normalization of relations with israel if it accepts the international consensus of
news of the two state settlement which has been blocked by the united states and israel for thirty years and that s
news s not a good story so it s either not mentioned or it s hidden somewhere it s very hard to
news to predict the bush administration today because they re deeply irrational they were irrational to start with but now they re
news re desperate they have created an unimaginable catastrophe in iraq this should ve been one of the easiest military occupations in
news in history and they succeeded in turning it into one of the worst military disasters in history they can t control
news control it and it s almost impossible for them to get out for reasons you can t discuss in the united
news united states because to discuss the reasons why they can t get out would be to concede the reasons why they
news they invaded we re supposed to believe that oil had nothing to do with it that if iraq were exporting pickles
news pickles or jelly and the center of world oil production were in the south pacific that the united states would ve
news ve liberated them anyway it has nothing to do with the oil what a crass idea anyone with their head screwed
news screwed on knows that that can t be true allowing an independent and sovereign iraq could be a nightmare for the
news the united states it would mean that it would be shi ite dominated at least if it s minimally democratic it
news it would continue to improve relations with iran just what the united states doesn t want to see and beyond that
news that right across the border in saudi arabia where most of saudi oil is there happens to be a large shi
news shi ite population probably a majority moves toward sovereignty in iraq stimulate pressures first for human rights among the bitterly repressed
news repressed shi ite population but also toward some degree of autonomy you can imagine a kind of a loose shi ite
news ite alliance in iraq saudi arabia and iran controlling most of the world s oil and independent of the united states
news states and much worse although europe can be intimidated by the united states china can t it s one of the
news the reasons the main reasons why china is considered a threat we re back to the mafia principle china has been
news been there for years has contempt for the barbarians is overcoming a century of domination and simply moves on its own
news own it does not get intimidated when uncle sam shakes his fist that s scary in particular it s dangerous in
news in the case of the middle east china is the center of the asian energy security grid which includes the central
news central asian states and russia india is also hovering around the edge south korea is involved and iran is an associate
news associate member of some kind if the middle east oil resources around the gulf which are the main ones in the
news the world if they link up to the asian grid the united states is really a second rate power a lot
news lot is at stake in not withdrawing from iraq i m sure that these issues are discussed in internal planning it
news it s inconceivable that they can t think of this but it s out of public discussion it s not in
news in the media it s not in the journals it s not in the baker hamilton report and i think you
news you can understand the reason to bring up these issues would open the question why the united states and britain invaded
news invaded and that question is taboo it s a principle that anything our leaders do is for noble reasons it may
news may be mistaken it may be ugly but basically noble and if you bring in normal moderate conservative strategic economic objectives
news objectives you threatening that principle it s remarkable the extent to which it s held so the original pretexts for the
news the invasion were weapons of mass destruction and ties to al qaida that nobody but maybe wolfowitz or cheney took seriously
news seriously the single question as they kept reiterating in the leadership was will saddam give up his programs of weapons of
news of mass destruction the single question was answered a couple of s later the wrong way and quickly the party line
news line shifted in november bush announced his freedom agenda our real goal is to bring democracy to iraq to transform the
news the middle east that became the party line instantly but it s a mistake to pick out individuals because it s
news s close to universal even in scholarship in fact you can even find scholarly articles that begin by giving the evidence
news evidence that it s complete farce but nevertheless accept it there was a pretty good study of the freedom agenda in
news in current history by two scholars and they give the facts they point out that the freedom agenda was announced on
news on november after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction but the freedom agenda is real even if there s
news s no evidence for it in fact if you look at our policies they re the opposite take palestine there was
news was a free election in palestine but it came out the wrong way so instantly the united states and israel with
news with europe tagging along moved to punish the palestinian people and punish them harshly because they voted the wrong way in
news in a free election that s accepted here in the west as perfectly normal that illustrates the deep hatred and contempt
news contempt for democracy among western elites so deep seated they can t even perceive it when it s in front of
news of their eyes you punish people severely if they vote the wrong way in a free election there s a pretext
news pretext for that too repeated every day hamas must agree to first recognize israel second to end all violence third to
news to accept past agreements try to find a mention of the fact that the united states and israel reject all three
news three of those they obviously don t recognize palestine they certainly don t withdraw the use of violence or the threat
news threat of it in fact they insist on it and they don t accept past agreements including the road map i
news i suspect one of the reasons why jimmy carter s book has come under such fierce attack is because it s
news s the first time i think in the mainstream that one can find the truth about the road map i have
news have never seen anything in the mainstream that discusses the fact that israel instantly rejected the road map with u s
news s support they formally accepted it but added reservations that totally eviscerated it it was done instantly it s public knowledge
news knowledge i ve about it talked about it so have others but i ve never seen it mentioned in the mainstream
news mainstream before and obviously they don t accept the arab league proposal or any other serious proposal in fact they ve
news ve been blocking the international consensus on the two state solution for decades but hamas has to accept them it really
news really makes no sense hamas is a political party and political parties don t recognize other countries and hamas itself has
news has made it very clear they actually carried out a truce for a year and a half didn t respond to
news to israeli attacks and have called for a long term truce during which it d be possible to negotiate a settlement
news settlement along the lines of the international consensus and the arab league proposal all of this is obvious it s right
news right on the surface and that s just one example of the deep hatred of democracy on the part of western
news western elites it s a striking example but you can add case after case yet the president announced the freedom agenda
news agenda and if the dear leader said something it s got to be true kind of north korean style therefore there
news there s a freedom agenda even if there s a mountain of evidence against it the only evidence for it is
news is in words even apart from the timing shank in the presidential election how will the candidates approach iran do you
news you think iran will be a deciding factor in the elections chomsky what they re saying so far is not encouraging
news encouraging i still think despite everything that the us is very unlikely to attack iran it could be a huge catastrophe
news catastrophe nobody knows what the consequences would be i imagine that only an administration that s really desperate would resort to
news to that but if the democratic candidates are on the verge of winning the election the administration is going to be
news be desperate it still has the problem of iraq can t stay in and can t get out shank the senate
news senate democrats can t seem to achieve consensus on this issue chomsky i think there s a reason for it the
news the reason is just thinking through the consequences of allowing an independent partially democratic iraq the consequences are nontrivial we may
news may decide to hide our heads in the sand and pretend we can t think it through because we cannot allow
news allow the question of why the united states invaded to open but that s very self destructive shank is there any
news any connection to this conversation and why we cannot find the political will and momentum to enact legislation that would reduce
news reduce c emissions levels institute a cap and trade system etc chomsky it s perfectly clear why the united states didn
news didn t sign the kyoto protocol again there s overwhelming popular support for signing in fact it s so strong that
news that a majority of bush voters in thought that he was in favor of the kyoto protocol it s such an
news an obvious thing to support popular support for alternative energy has been very high for years but it harms corporate profits
news profits after all that s the administration s constituency i remember talking to years ago one of the leading people in
news in the government who was involved in arms control pressing for arms control measures d eacute tente and so on he
news he s very high up and we were talking about whether arms control could succeed and only partially as a joke
news joke he said ldquo well it might succeed if the high tech industry makes more profit from arms control than it
news it can make from weapons related research and production if we get to that tipping point maybe arms control will work
news work rdquo he was partially joking but there s a truth that lies behind it shank how do we move forward
news forward on climate change without beggaring the south chomsky unfortunately the poor countries the south are going to suffer the worst
news worst according to most projections mdash and that being so it undermines support in the north for doing much look at
news at the ozone story as long as it was the southern hemisphere that was being threatened there was very little talk
news talk about it when it was discovered in the north very quickly actions were taken to do something about it right
news right now there s discussion of putting serious effort into developing a malaria vaccine because global warming might extend malaria to
news to the rich countries so something should be done about it same thing on health insurance here s an issue where
news where for the general population it s been the leading domestic issue or close to it for years and there s
news s a consensus for a national healthcare system on the model of other industrial countries maybe expanding medicare to everyone or
news or something like that well that s off the agenda nobody can talk about that the insurance companies don t like
news like it the financial industry doesn t like and so on now there s a change taking place what s happening
news happening is that manufacturing industries are beginning to turn to support for it because they re being undermined by the hopelessly
news hopelessly inefficient u s healthcare system it s the worst in the industrial world by far and they have to pay
news pay for it since it s employer compensated in part their production costs are much higher than those competitors who have
news have a national healthcare system take gm if it produces the same car in detroit and in windsor across the border
news border in canada it saves i forget the number i think over with the windsor production because there s a national
news national healthcare system it s much more efficient it s much cheaper it s much more effective so the manufacturing industry
news industry is starting to press for some kind of national healthcare now it s beginning to put it on the agenda
news agenda it doesn t matter if the population wants it what of the population wants would be kind of irrelevant but
news but if part of the concentration of corporate capital that basically runs the country another thing we re not allowed to
news to say but it s obvious if part of that sector becomes in favor then the issue moves onto the political
news political agenda shank so how does the south get its voice heard on the international agenda is the world social forum
news forum a place for it chomsky the world social forum is very important but of course that can t be covered
news covered in the west in fact i remember reading an article i think in the financial times about the two major
news major forums that were taking place one was the world economic forum in davos and a second was a forum in
news in herzeliyah in israel a right wing forum in herzeliyah those were the two forums of course there was also the
news the world social forum in nairobi but that s only tens of thousands of people from around the world shank with
news with the trend towards vilifying the g at the un one wonders where the developing world can effectively voice their concerns
news concerns chomsky the developing world voice can be amplified enormously by support from the wealthy and the privileged otherwise it s
news s very likely to be marginalized as in every other issue the role of the neocons in our government since they
news they invaded and occupied the white house is seldom if ever mentioned by the main stream media my information sources are
news are limited and it is difficult to assess their credibility but the argument can be made that but for the neocons
news neocons we would not be in danger of permanently losing our democracy with its rights and obligations duties and privileges the

news the september agreement that one is now coming back just in the last few days the way it rsquo s portrayed
news portrayed in the u s media is as usual with the government rsquo s party line that north korea is now
news now perhaps a little more amenable to accept the september proposal so there rsquo s some optimism if you go across
news across the atlantic to the financial times to review the same events they point out that an embattled bush administration it
news it rsquo s their phrase needs some kind of victory so maybe it rsquo ll be willing to move towards diplomacy
news diplomacy it rsquo s a little more accurate i think if you look at the background but there is some minimal
news minimal sense of optimism about it if you look back over the record mdash and north korea is a horrible place
news place nobody is arguing about that mdash on this issue they rsquo ve been pretty rational it rsquo s been a
news a kind of tit for tat history if the united states is accommodating the north koreans become accommodating if the united
news united states is hostile they become hostile that rsquo s reviewed pretty well by leon sigal who rsquo s one of
news of the leading specialists on this in a recent issue of current history but that rsquo s been the general picture
news picture and we rsquo re now at a place where there could be a settlement on north korea that rsquo s
news s much less significant for the united states than the iranian issue i don rsquo t think has much to do
news do with nuclear weapons frankly nobody is saying iran should have nuclear weapons ndash nor should anybody else but the point
news point in the middle east as distinct from north korea is that this is center of the world rsquo s energy
news energy resources originally the british and secondarily the french had dominated it but after the second world war it rsquo s
news s been a u s preserve that rsquo s been an axiom of u s foreign policy that it must control
news control middle east energy resources it is not a matter of access as people often say once the oil is on
news on the seas it goes anywhere in fact if the united states used no middle east oil it rsquo d have
news have the same policies if we went on solar energy tomorrow it rsquo d keep the same policies just look at
news at the internal record or the logic of it the issue has always been control control is the source of strategic
news strategic power dick cheney declared in kazakhstan or somewhere that control over pipeline is a ldquo tool of intimidation and blackmail
news blackmail rdquo when we have control over the pipelines it rsquo s a tool of benevolence if other countries have control
news control over the sources of energy and the distribution of energy then it is a tool of intimidation and blackmail exactly
news exactly as cheney said and that rsquo s been understood as far back as george kennan and the early post war
news war days when he pointed out that if the united states controls middle east resources it rsquo ll have veto power
news power over its industrial rivals he was speaking particularly of japan but the point generalizes so is a different situation it
news it rsquo s part of the major energy system of the world shank so when the united states considers a potential
news potential invasion you think it rsquo s under the premise of gaining control that is what the united states will gain
news gain from attacking chomsky there are several issues in the case of iran one is simply that it is independent and
news and independence is not tolerated sometimes it rsquo s called successful defiance in the internal record take cuba a very large
news large majority of the u s population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with cuba and has been for a
news a long time with some fluctuations and even part of the business world is in favor of it too but the
news the government won rsquo t allow it it rsquo s attributed to the florida vote but i don rsquo t think
news think that rsquo s much of an explanation i think it has to do with a feature of world affairs that
news that is insufficiently appreciated international affairs is very much run like the mafia the godfather does not accept disobedience even from
news from a small storekeeper who doesn rsquo t pay his protection money you have to have obedience otherwise the idea can
news can spread that you don rsquo t have to listen to the orders and it can spread to important places if
news if you look back at the record what was the main reason for the u s attack on vietnam independent development
news development can be a virus that can infect others that rsquo s the way it rsquo s been put kissinger in
news in this case referring to allende in chile and with cuba it rsquo s explicit in the internal record arthur schlesinger
news schlesinger presenting the report of the latin american study group to incoming president kennedy wrote that the danger is the spread
news spread of the castro idea of taking matters into your own hands which has a lot of appeal to others in
news in the same region that suffer from the same problems later internal documents charged cuba with successful defiance of u s
news s policies going back years ndash to the monroe doctrine and that can rsquo t be tolerated so there rsquo s
news s kind of a state commitment to ensuring obedience going back to iran it rsquo s not only that it has
news has substantial resources and that it rsquo s part of the world rsquo s major energy system but it also defied
news defied the united states the united states as we know overthrew the parliamentary government installed a brutal tyrant was helping him
news him develop nuclear power in fact the very same programs that are now considered a threat were being sponsored by the
news the u s government by cheney wolfowitz kissinger and others in the s as long as the shah was in power
news power but then the iranians overthrew him and they kept u s hostages for several hundred days and the united states
news states immediately turned to supporting saddam hussein and his war against as a way of punishing iran the united states is
news is going to continue to punish iran because of its defiance so that rsquo s a separate factor and again the
news the will of the u s population and even us business is considered mostly irrelevant seventy five percent of the population
news population here favors improving relations with iran instead of threats but this is disregarded we don rsquo t have polls from
news from the business world but it rsquo s pretty clear that the energy corporations would be quite happy to be given
news given authorization to go back into iran instead of leaving all that to their rivals but the state won rsquo t
news t allow it and it is setting up confrontations right now very explicitly part of the reason is strategic geo political
news political economic but part of the reason is the mafia complex they have to be punished for disobeying us shank venezuela
news venezuela has been successfully defiant with chavez making a swing towards socialism where are they on our list chomsky they rsquo
news rsquo re very high the united states sponsored and supported a military coup to overthrow the government in fact that rsquo
news rsquo s its last most recent effort in what used to be a conventional resort to such measures shank but why
news why haven rsquo t we turned our sights more toward venezuela chomsky oh they rsquo re there there rsquo s a
news a constant stream of abuse and attack by the government and therefore the media who are almost reflexively against venezuela for
news for several reasons venezuela is independent it rsquo s diversifying its exports to a limited extent instead of just being dependent
news dependent on exports to the united states and it rsquo s initiating moves toward latin american integration and independence it rsquo
news rsquo s what they call a bolivarian alternative and the united states doesn rsquo t like any of that this again
news again is defiance of u s policies going back to the monroe doctrine there rsquo s now a standard interpretation of
news of this trend in latin america another kind of party line latin america is all moving to the left from venezuela
news venezuela to argentina with rare exceptions but there rsquo s a good left and a bad left the good left is
news is garcia and lula and then there rsquo s the bad left which is chavez morales maybe correa and that rsquo
news rsquo s the split in order to maintain that position it rsquo s necessary to resort to some fancy footwork for
news for example it rsquo s necessary not to report the fact that when lula was re elected in october his foreign
news foreign trip and one of his first acts was to visit caracas to support chavez and his electoral campaign and to
news to dedicate a joint venezuelan brazilian project on the orinoco river to talk about new projects and so on it rsquo
news rsquo s necessary not to report the fact that a couple of weeks later in cochabamba bolivia which is the heart
news heart of the bad guys there was a meeting of all south american leaders there had been bad blood between chavez
news chavez and garcia but it was apparently patched up they laid plans for pretty constructive south american integration but that just
news just doesn rsquo t fit the u s agenda so it wasn rsquo t reported shank how is the political deadlock
news deadlock in lebanon impacting the u s government rsquo s decision to potentially go to war with iran is there a
news a relationship at all chomsky there rsquo s a relationship i presume part of the reason for the u s israel
news israel invasion of lebanon in july mdash and it is us israeli the lebanese are correct in calling it that mdash
news mdash part of the reason i suppose was that hezbollah is considered a deterrent to a potential u s israeli attack
news attack on iran it had a deterrent capacity i e rockets and the goal i presume was to wipe out the
news the deterrent so as to free up the united states and israel for an eventual attack on iran that rsquo s
news s at least part of the reason the official reason given for the invasion can rsquo t be taken seriously for
news for a moment that rsquo s the capture of two israeli soldiers and the killing of a couple others for decades
news decades israel has been capturing and kidnapping lebanese and palestinian refugees on the high seas from cyprus to lebanon killing them
news them in lebanon bringing them to israel holding them as hostages it rsquo s been going on for decades has anybody
news anybody called for an invasion of israel of course israel doesn rsquo t want any competition in the region but there
news there rsquo s no principled basis for the massive attack on lebanon which was horrendous in fact one of the last
news last acts of the u s israeli invasion right after the ceasefire was announced before it was implemented was to saturate
news saturate much of the south with cluster bombs there rsquo s no military purpose for that the war was over the
news the ceasefire was coming un de mining groups that are working there say that the scale is unprecedented it rsquo s
news s much worse than any other place they rsquo ve worked kosovo afghanistan iraq anywhere there are supposed to be about
news about one million bomblets left there a large percentage of them don rsquo t explode until you pick them up a
news a child picks them up or a farmer hits it with a hoe or something so what it does basically is
news is make the south uninhabitable until the mining teams for which the united states and israel don rsquo t contribute clean
news clean it up this is arable land it means that farmers can rsquo t go back it means that it may
news may undermine a potential hezbollah deterrent they apparently have pretty much withdrawn from the south according to the un you can
news can rsquo t mention hezbollah in the u s media without putting in the context of ldquo iranian supported hezbollah rdquo
news rdquo that rsquo s its name its name is iranian supported hezbollah it gets iranian support but you can mention israel
news israel without saying us supported israel so this is more tacit propaganda the idea that hezbollah is acting as an agent
news agent of iran is very dubious it rsquo s not accepted by specialists on iran or specialists on hezbollah but it
news it rsquo s the party line or sometimes you can put in syria i e ldquo syrian supported hezbollah rdquo but
news but since syria is of less interest now you have to emphasize iranian support shank how can the u s government
news government think an attack on iran is feasible given troop availability troop capacity and public sentiment chomsky as far as i
news i rsquo m aware the military in the united states thinks it rsquo s crazy and from whatever leaks we have
news have from intelligence the intelligence community thinks it rsquo s outlandish but not impossible if you look at people who have
news have really been involved in the pentagon rsquo s strategic planning for years people like sam gardiner they point out that
news that there are things that possibly could be done i don rsquo t think any of the outside commentators at least
news least as far as i rsquo m aware have taken very seriously the idea of bombing nuclear facilities they say if
news if there will be bombing it rsquo ll be carpet bombing so get the nuclear facilities but get the rest of
news of the country too with an exception by accident of geography the world rsquo s major oil resources are in shi
news shi rsquo ite dominated areas iran rsquo s oil is concentrated right near the gulf which happens to be an arab
news arab area not persian khuzestan is arab has been loyal to iran fought with iran not iraq during the iran iraq
news iraq war this is a potential source of dissension i would be amazed if there isn rsquo t an attempt going
news going on to stir up secessionist elements in khuzestan u s forces right across the border in iraq including the surge
news surge are available potentially to ldquo defend rdquo an independent khuzestan against iran which is the way it would be put
news put if they can carry it off shank do you think that rsquo s what the surge was for chomsky that
news that rsquo s one possibility there was a release of a pentagon war gaming report in december with gardiner leading it
news it it was released and published in the atlantic ly they couldn rsquo t come up with a proposal that didn
news didn rsquo t lead to disaster but one of the things they considered was maintaining troop presence in iraq beyond what
news what rsquo s to be used in iraq for troop replacement and so on and use them for a potential land
news land move in iran presumably khuzestan where the oil is if you could carry that off you could just bomb the
news the rest of the country to dust again i would be amazed if there aren rsquo t efforts to sponsor secessionist
news secessionist movements elsewhere among the azeri population for example it rsquo s a very complex ethnic mix in iran much of
news of the population isn rsquo t persian there are secessionist tendencies anyway and almost certainly without knowing any of the facts
news facts the united states is trying to stir them up to break the country internally if possible the strategy appears to
news to be try to break the country up internally try to impel the leadership to be as harsh and brutal as
news as possible that rsquo s the immediate consequence of constant threats everyone knows that that rsquo s one of the reasons
news reasons the reformists shirin ebadi and akbar ganji and others are bitterly complaining about the u s threats that it rsquo
news rsquo s undermining their efforts to reform and democratize iran but that rsquo s presumably its purpose since it rsquo s
news s an obvious consequence you have to assume it rsquo s the purpose just like in law anticipated consequences are taken
news taken as the evidence for intention and here rsquo s it so obvious you can rsquo t seriously doubt it so
news so it could be that one strain of the policy is to stir up secessionist movements particularly in the oil rich
news rich regions the arab regions near the gulf also the azeri regions and others second is to try to get the
news the leadership to be as brutal and harsh and repressive as possible to stir up internal disorder and maybe resistance and
news and a third is to try to pressure other countries and europe is the most amenable to join efforts to strangle
news strangle iran economically europe is kind of dragging its feet but they usually go along with the united states the efforts
news efforts to intensify the harshness of the regime show up in many ways for example the west absolutely adores ahmadinejad any
news any wild statement that he comes out with immediately gets circulated in headlines and mistranslated they love him but anybody who
news who knows anything about iran presumably the editorial offices knows that he doesn rsquo t have anything to do with foreign
news foreign policy foreign policy is in the hands of his superior the supreme leader khamenei but they don rsquo t report
news report his statements particularly when his statements are pretty conciliatory for example they love when ahmadinejad says that israel shouldn rsquo
news rsquo t exist but they don rsquo t like it when khamenei right afterwards says that iran supports the arab league
news league position on israel palestine as far as i rsquo m aware it never got reported actually you could find khamenei
news khamenei rsquo s more conciliatory positions in the financial times but not here and it rsquo s repeated by iranian diplomats
news diplomats but that rsquo s no good the arab league proposal calls for normalization of relations with israel if it accepts
news accepts the international consensus of the two state settlement which has been blocked by the united states and israel for thirty
news thirty years and that rsquo s not a good story so it rsquo s either not mentioned or it rsquo s
news s hidden somewhere it rsquo s very hard to predict the bush administration today because they rsquo re deeply irrational they
news they were irrational to start with but now they rsquo re desperate they have created an unimaginable catastrophe in iraq this
news this should rsquo ve been one of the easiest military occupations in history and they succeeded in turning it into one
news one of the worst military disasters in history they can rsquo t control it and it rsquo s almost impossible for
news for them to get out for reasons you can rsquo t discuss in the united states because to discuss the reasons
news reasons why they can rsquo t get out would be to concede the reasons why they invaded we rsquo re supposed
news supposed to believe that oil had nothing to do with it that if iraq were exporting pickles or jelly and the
news the center of world oil production were in the south pacific that the united states would rsquo ve liberated them anyway
news anyway it has nothing to do with the oil what a crass idea anyone with their head screwed on knows that
news that that can rsquo t be true allowing an independent and sovereign iraq could be a nightmare for the united states
news states it would mean that it would be shi rsquo ite dominated at least if it rsquo s minimally democratic it
news it would continue to improve relations with iran just what the united states doesn rsquo t want to see and beyond
news beyond that right across the border in saudi arabia where most of saudi oil is there happens to be a large
news large shi rsquo ite population probably a majority moves toward sovereignty in iraq stimulate pressures first for human rights among the
news the bitterly repressed shi rsquo ite population but also toward some degree of autonomy you can imagine a kind of a
news a loose shi rsquo ite alliance in iraq saudi arabia and iran controlling most of the world rsquo s oil and
news and independent of the united states and much worse although europe can be intimidated by the united states china can rsquo
news rsquo t it rsquo s one of the reasons the main reasons why china is considered a threat we rsquo re
news re back to the mafia principle china has been there for years has contempt for the barbarians is overcoming a century
news century of domination and simply moves on its own it does not get intimidated when uncle sam shakes his fist that
news that rsquo s scary in particular it rsquo s dangerous in the case of the middle east china is the center
news center of the asian energy security grid which includes the central asian states and russia india is also hovering around the
news the edge south korea is involved and iran is an associate member of some kind if the middle east oil resources
news resources around the gulf which are the main ones in the world if they link up to the asian grid the
news the united states is really a second rate power a lot is at stake in not withdrawing from iraq i rsquo
news rsquo m sure that these issues are discussed in internal planning it rsquo s inconceivable that they can rsquo t think
news think of this but it rsquo s out of public discussion it rsquo s not in the media it rsquo s
news s not in the journals it rsquo s not in the baker hamilton report and i think you can understand the
news the reason to bring up these issues would open the question why the united states and britain invaded and that question
news question is taboo it rsquo s a principle that anything our leaders do is for noble reasons it may be mistaken
news mistaken it may be ugly but basically noble and if you bring in normal moderate conservative strategic economic objectives you threatening
news threatening that principle it rsquo s remarkable the extent to which it rsquo s held so the original pretexts for the
news the invasion were weapons of mass destruction and ties to al qaida that nobody but maybe wolfowitz or cheney took seriously
news seriously the single question as they kept reiterating in the leadership was will saddam give up his programs of weapons of
news of mass destruction the single question was answered a couple of s later the wrong way and quickly the party line
news line shifted in november bush announced his freedom agenda our real goal is to bring democracy to iraq to transform the
news the middle east that became the party line instantly but it rsquo s a mistake to pick out individuals because it
news it rsquo s close to universal even in scholarship in fact you can even find scholarly articles that begin by giving
news giving the evidence that it rsquo s complete farce but nevertheless accept it there was a pretty good study of the
news the freedom agenda in current history by two scholars and they give the facts they point out that the freedom agenda
news agenda was announced on november after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction but the freedom agenda is real even
news even if there rsquo s no evidence for it in fact if you look at our policies they rsquo re the
news the opposite take palestine there was a free election in palestine but it came out the wrong way so instantly the
news the united states and israel with europe tagging along moved to punish the palestinian people and punish them harshly because they
news they voted the wrong way in a free election that rsquo s accepted here in the west as perfectly normal that
news that illustrates the deep hatred and contempt for democracy among western elites so deep seated they can rsquo t even perceive
news perceive it when it rsquo s in front of their eyes you punish people severely if they vote the wrong way
news way in a free election there rsquo s a pretext for that too repeated every day hamas must agree to first
news first recognize israel second to end all violence third to accept past agreements try to find a mention of the fact
news fact that the united states and israel reject all three of those they obviously don rsquo t recognize palestine they certainly
news certainly don rsquo t withdraw the use of violence or the threat of it in fact they insist on it and
news and they don rsquo t accept past agreements including the road map i suspect one of the reasons why jimmy carter
news carter rsquo s book has come under such fierce attack is because it rsquo s the first time i think in
news in the mainstream that one can find the truth about the road map i have never seen anything in the mainstream
news mainstream that discusses the fact that israel instantly rejected the road map with u s support they formally accepted it but
news but added reservations that totally eviscerated it it was done instantly it rsquo s public knowledge i rsquo ve about it
news it talked about it so have others but i rsquo ve never seen it mentioned in the mainstream before and obviously
news obviously they don rsquo t accept the arab league proposal or any other serious proposal in fact they rsquo ve been
news been blocking the international consensus on the two state solution for decades but hamas has to accept them it really makes
news makes no sense hamas is a political party and political parties don rsquo t recognize other countries and hamas itself has
news has made it very clear they actually carried out a truce for a year and a half didn rsquo t respond
news respond to israeli attacks and have called for a long term truce during which it rsquo d be possible to negotiate
news negotiate a settlement along the lines of the international consensus and the arab league proposal all of this is obvious it
news it rsquo s right on the surface and that rsquo s just one example of the deep hatred of democracy on
news on the part of western elites it rsquo s a striking example but you can add case after case yet the
news the president announced the freedom agenda and if the dear leader said something it rsquo s got to be true kind
news kind of north korean style therefore there rsquo s a freedom agenda even if there rsquo s a mountain of evidence
news evidence against it the only evidence for it is in words even apart from the timing shank in the presidential election
news election how will the candidates approach iran do you think iran will be a deciding factor in the elections chomsky what
news what they rsquo re saying so far is not encouraging i still think despite everything that the us is very unlikely
news unlikely to attack iran it could be a huge catastrophe nobody knows what the consequences would be i imagine that only
news only an administration that rsquo s really desperate would resort to that but if the democratic candidates are on the verge
news verge of winning the election the administration is going to be desperate it still has the problem of iraq can rsquo
news rsquo t stay in and can rsquo t get out shank the senate democrats can rsquo t seem to achieve consensus
news consensus on this issue chomsky i think there rsquo s a reason for it the reason is just thinking through the
news the consequences of allowing an independent partially democratic iraq the consequences are nontrivial we may decide to hide our heads in
news in the sand and pretend we can rsquo t think it through because we cannot allow the question of why the
news the united states invaded to open but that rsquo s very self destructive shank is there any connection to this conversation
news conversation and why we cannot find the political will and momentum to enact legislation that would reduce c emissions levels institute
news institute a cap and trade system etc chomsky it rsquo s perfectly clear why the united states didn rsquo t sign
news sign the kyoto protocol again there rsquo s overwhelming popular support for signing in fact it rsquo s so strong that
news that a majority of bush voters in thought that he was in favor of the kyoto protocol it rsquo s such
news such an obvious thing to support popular support for alternative energy has been very high for years but it harms corporate
news corporate profits after all that rsquo s the administration rsquo s constituency i remember talking to years ago one of the
news the leading people in the government who was involved in arms control pressing for arms control measures d eacute tente and
news and so on he rsquo s very high up and we were talking about whether arms control could succeed and only
news only partially as a joke he said ldquo well it might succeed if the high tech industry makes more profit from
news from arms control than it can make from weapons related research and production if we get to that tipping point maybe
news maybe arms control will work rdquo he was partially joking but there rsquo s a truth that lies behind it shank
news shank how do we move forward on climate change without beggaring the south chomsky unfortunately the poor countries the south are
news are going to suffer the worst according to most projections mdash and that being so it undermines support in the north
news north for doing much look at the ozone story as long as it was the southern hemisphere that was being threatened
news threatened there was very little talk about it when it was discovered in the north very quickly actions were taken to
news to do something about it right now there rsquo s discussion of putting serious effort into developing a malaria vaccine because
news because global warming might extend malaria to the rich countries so something should be done about it same thing on health
news health insurance here rsquo s an issue where for the general population it rsquo s been the leading domestic issue or
news or close to it for years and there rsquo s a consensus for a national healthcare system on the model of
news of other industrial countries maybe expanding medicare to everyone or something like that well that rsquo s off the agenda nobody
news nobody can talk about that the insurance companies don rsquo t like it the financial industry doesn rsquo t like and
news and so on now there rsquo s a change taking place what rsquo s happening is that manufacturing industries are beginning
news beginning to turn to support for it because they rsquo re being undermined by the hopelessly inefficient u s healthcare system
news system it rsquo s the worst in the industrial world by far and they have to pay for it since it
news it rsquo s employer compensated in part their production costs are much higher than those competitors who have a national healthcare
news healthcare system take gm if it produces the same car in detroit and in windsor across the border in canada it
news it saves i forget the number i think over with the windsor production because there rsquo s a national healthcare system
news system it rsquo s much more efficient it rsquo s much cheaper it rsquo s much more effective so the manufacturing
news manufacturing industry is starting to press for some kind of national healthcare now it rsquo s beginning to put it on
news on the agenda it doesn rsquo t matter if the population wants it what of the population wants would be kind
news kind of irrelevant but if part of the concentration of corporate capital that basically runs the country another thing we rsquo
news rsquo re not allowed to say but it rsquo s obvious if part of that sector becomes in favor then the
news the issue moves onto the political agenda shank so how does the south get its voice heard on the international agenda
news agenda is the world social forum a place for it chomsky the world social forum is very important but of course
news course that can rsquo t be covered in the west in fact i remember reading an article i think in the
news the financial times about the two major forums that were taking place one was the world economic forum in davos and
news and a second was a forum in herzeliyah in israel a right wing forum in herzeliyah those were the two forums
news forums of course there was also the world social forum in nairobi but that rsquo s only tens of thousands of
news of people from around the world shank with the trend towards vilifying the g at the un one wonders where the
news the developing world can effectively voice their concerns chomsky the developing world voice can be amplified enormously by support from the
news the wealthy and the privileged otherwise it rsquo s very likely to be marginalized as in every other issue shank so

news and popular online presence which is understandable the weather affects most everyone s life and the internet can provide information on
news on just about any location at any hour of the day or night but how accurate is this information how much
news much can we trust it perhaps it is just my skeptical nature or maybe the seeming unpredictability of nature but i
news i ve never put much weight into weather forecasts especially those made more than three days in advance that skepticism progressed
news progressed to a new high in the summer of but i have only now done the research necessary to test the
news the accuracy of online weather forecasts first the story then the data an internet weather forecast gone terribly awry it was
news was the summer of and my wife and i were gearing up for a trip with another couple to schlitterbahn in
news in new braunfels one of the if not the best waterparks ever created as a matter of course when embarking on
news on a hour drive to spend the day in a swimsuit and given the tendency of the area for natural disasters
news disasters we checked the weather the temperatures looked ideal and most importantly the chance of rain was a nice round goose
news goose egg a couple of hours into our schlitterbahn experience we got on a bus to leave the x old section
news section x for the x new section x along the way clouds gathered and multiple claps of thunder sounded x so
news so much for the chance of rain x i commented by the time we got to our destination lightning sightings had
news had led to the slides and pools being evacuated and soon the rain began coming down in torrents accompanied by voluminous
news voluminous lightning flashes after at least a half an hour the downpour had subsided but the lightning showed no sign of
news of letting up so we began heading back to our vehicles a hundred yards into the parking lot we passing a
news a tree that had apparently been split in two during the storm whether by lightning or wind i m not sure
news sure not but a few yards later there was a distinct thud and the husband of the couple accompanying us cried
news cried out as a near racquetball sized hunk of ice rebounded off of his head and onto the concrete soon similarly
news similarly sized hail was falling all around us as everyone scampered for cover some cowered under overturned trashcans while others were
news were more fortunate and made it indoors the hail rain and lightning eventually subsided but the most alarming news was waiting
news waiting on cell phone voicemail a friend who lived in the area had called frantically knowing we were at the park
news park as the local news was reporting multiple people had been by struck by lightning at schlitterbahn during the storm x
news x so much for the chance of rain x i repeated testing the skepticism after that experience i gave up using
news using online weather forecasts actually any weather forecast for more than getting a reasonable idea of the x temperature decade x
news x for the next day i ve recently begun to be a little skeptical of my own skepticism however what if
news if i was the victim of a freak waterpark occurrence and was missing out on the typically reliable weather information online
news online using a spreadsheet observed data and straightforward statistics i was set to find out my plan was to record the
news the weather forecasts of some of the most popular internet weather sites as well as actual temperatures and then to analyze
news analyze the data to determine each site s accuracy i would then be able to draw supported conclusions to apply to
news to future use of internet weather forecasts if any data mining internet weather forecasts doing an internet search for various weather
news weather related keywords and then cross referencing to avoid duplication i selected the top ten weather forecast sites to be included
news included in my survey using their google toolbar pagerank pr additionally i selected houston texas as the location and the weather
news weather channel as my x actual temperature x source the national weather service pr bbc weather pr the weather channel pr
news pr the weather underground pr intellicast pr cnn weather pr msn weather pr the weather network pr unisys pr accuweather pr
news pr actual as reported on weather com then on a daily basis i recorded the predicted low and high temperatures on
news on each weather forecast site going back as far as was made available this varied greatly from site to site with
news with cnn weather bbc weather the weather underground and the weather network providing only the current day and four days into
news into the future and accuweather providing the current day and four teen days into the future i usually logged the data
news data at pm cst but occasionally as late as pm cst which resulted in some high temperature predictions for the current
news current day not being available as well as oddly enough the low temperature not being available in a few cases i
news i also recorded average and record temperatures for all days considered table sample portion of data sheet calculations on forecast accuracy
news accuracy and consistency in order to assess the accuracy and consistency of each weather forecast site i first found the absolute
news absolute values of the differences between the predicted and actual temperatures for example considering the data presented in table above the
news the actual high temperature in houston tx on thursday december st was f at noon on thursday december th the weather
news weather channel online predicted the high on that day would be f off of the actual and yielding an x accuracy
news accuracy value x of on the same day msn weather online predicted a high of f corresponding to a value of
news of the higher number indicating a poorer performance the tables turned somewhat two days later when the weather channel predicted and
news and msn weather predicted resulting in accuracy values of and respectively next i calculated the mean and standard deviation of these
news these accuracy values for each weather forecast site and predictive period e g accuweather two days in advance the weather network
news network four days in advance etc the mean value representing the average accuracy and the standard deviation representing the consistency or
news or x spread x of the accuracy values the ing tables and graphs summarize the gathered weather forecast accuracy and consistency
news consistency data by organizing it into columns by the number of days previous note than in both cases a lower number
news number represents a better performance table average accuracy of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous lower is
news is better figure average accuracy of the high temperature forecasts of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous
news previous lower is better figure average accuracy of the low temperature forecasts of each weather forecast site by the number of
news of days previous lower is better table consistency of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous lower is
news is better figure consistency of the high temperature forecasts of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous lower
news lower is better figure consistency of the low temperature forecasts of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous
news previous lower is better ranking forecasts by accuracy and consistency i then ranked the accuracy and consistency of each weather forecast
news forecast site as compared to the competing sites i e the other sites providing forecasts note that days through were omitted
news omitted as accuweather was the only site providing a weather forecast table accuracy rank of each weather forecast site by the
news the number of days previous higher is better table consistency rank of each weather forecast site by the number of days
news days previous higher is better additionally i organized the accuracy and consistency rankings with respect to short mid and longterm weather
news weather forecasts as dictated by the data groupings i scored each weather forecast site with points corresponding to each ranking it
news it received within the specified time period for example in order to rank weather forecast sites in the short term grouping
news grouping days in advance i multiplied the number of first place ranks by added the number of second place ranks multiplied
news multiplied by and continued in this manner through adding the number of tenth place rankings multiplied by the higher the score
news score the higher the ranking mid and long term group rankings were similarly determined with the calculations modified to fit the
news the number of participating weather forecast sites table accuracy rank groupings for short days previous mid days previous and long term
news term days previous weather forecasts table consistency rank groupings for short days previous mid days previous and long term days previous
news previous weather forecasts correlation of variables to weather forecast accuracy and consistency i also ran correlation analysis on various factors to
news to see if they explained any of the accuracy differences observed specifically i analyzed the ing variables in order to check
news check for the listed corresponding correlation trends number trends over time i numbered the days for which the temperature was being
news being forecast from to starting with december and ending with january day trends with the day of the week hi lo
news lo trends between high and low forecasts if the forecast was for a daytime high this value was if it was
news was for an overnight low it was site trends between different sites again a column for each site was used with
news with a value for when the particular site was making the prediction and a value when it was another site previous
news previous trends between the number of days ahead the forecast was predicting starting with predictions made on the same day i
news i e the forecast for today s high or tonight s low this value ran from to table accuracy data arranged
news arranged for correlation analysis i compared the resulting correlation values with some standard values to determine if there were small medium
news medium large or no trends correlating with the weather forecast accuracy numbers table standard limits for interpreting correlation values table correlation
news correlation values between various variables and weather forecast accuracy these results indicated a trend for more accurate weather forecasts closer to
news to the temperature in question and when a high temperature is being predicted no weather forecast site was shown to be
news be significantly more accurate than another though something that does not seem to jive with the previously generated tables and graphs
news graphs it is important to note however that these values are generalized over all forecasting periods and for both high and
news and low temperatures i ran another correlation analysis to remove these variables just the high temperature forecasts published days previous in
news in this case table correlation values by weather forecast site for high temperature forecasts made days previous these numbers again showed
news showed no significant correlation between the weather forecast site and the accuracy of the weather forecast looking back at figure and
news and table however this wasn t too surprising the forecast accuracies in this selection were reasonably tightly grouped with the exception
news exception of bbc and bbc was on the verge of having a small correlation i made another selection and ran a
news a third correlation analysis this time on the more loosely grouped accuracy values for low temperature forecasts published days previous these
news these numbers showed small correlations for msn and unisys which are reflected by the relatively large separation from the pack in
news in figure and table table correlation values by weather forecast site for low temperature forecasts days previous conclusion while the tabled
news tabled rankings brought out the competitor in me it was obvious from the correlation analysis that only the numbers clearly x
news x separate from the pack x in figures are better or worse enough as to be statistically significant thus there were
news were a few shiners and a few duds but the variation among the rest can be explained away by chance the
news the trends i observed included in seeking high temperature forecasts it looked best to use intellicast or the weather channel in
news in the long term but there wasn t a clear leader in the short to mid term bbc seemed unreliable in
news in all cases as well as msn in the long term the weather network cnn and unisys all had blemishes and
news and days in advance respectively but were generally in with the pack in seeking low temperature forecasts intellicast and the weather
news weather channel were again the choice in the long term joined by unisys in the short term bbc was still a
news a dud in anything but the very short term and msn performed horribly in nearly all cases as well as accuweather
news accuweather in the long term accuweather was the clear leader in anything greater than days in advance being the only site
news site providing a weather forecast in addition to the above observations recommendations it was clear from the correlation analysis that the
news the further removed a weather forecast is the less accurate it will likely be much more unexpectedly however it was also
news also clear that predictions of the overnight low temperature are less accurate than those of the daytime high overall the accuracy
news accuracy and consistency values prescribed caution even when considering the most accurate and consistent weather forecasts for example if i wanted
news wanted to know the high temperature for tomorrow the numbers showed cnn weather to be the most accurate internet weather resource
news resource its weather forecast however comes with an average accuracy value of over and a consistency value of over thus the
news the conscientious browser would need to mentally append x with an accuracy of x to the temperature prediction and realize this
news this results in a two degree span at best and a ten degree span at worst this means a pessimist would
news would be justified in reading a prediction of x x for tomorrow s high as nothing more than x x and
news and this using the best online resource available granted the optimist would also be justified in reading the same prediction as
news as x x but it s always best to plan for the worst case especially when going to schlitterbahn many of
news of the other less accurate weather forecasts then seem to be practically worthless for all but the most optimistic take for
news for example the best option for determining the overnight low temperature a week from today the weather channel the appropriate accuracy
news accuracy baggage on this internet weather forecast site would be pessimistically reducing a forecast of x x to x x perhaps
news perhaps this explains why only four sites ventured to provide weather forecasts more than a week in advance and four others
news others didn t even push beyond four days so what of my skepticism i d say it s going strong while
news while the difference between online weather forecast sites was less than i expected the accuracy and consistency results support a strong
news strong dose of skepticism anytime you lookup the weather on the internet notes x schlitterbahn waterpark resort x schlitterbahn com accessed

physics physics natural philosophy and a natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion through space and time along
physics along with related concepts such as energy and force general analysis of nature conducted in order to understand how the universe
physics universe behaves physics is one of the oldest astronomy physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry certain branches
physics branches of mathematics and biology but during the scientific revolution in the th century the natural sciences emerged as unique research
physics research programs in their own right physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research such as biophysics and quantum chemistry and
physics and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined new ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences
physics sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy physics also makes significant contributions through advances
physics advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs for example advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led
physics led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern day society such as television computers domestic appliances
physics appliances and nuclear weapons advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization and advances in mechanics inspired the development of
physics of calculus natural philosophy has its origins in greece during the archaic period bce bce when pre socratic philosophers like thales
physics thales rejected non naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause they proposed ideas verified
physics verified by reason and observation and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment for example atomism classical physics became a
physics a separate science when early modern europeans used these experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be
physics be the laws of physics kepler galileo and more specifically newton discovered and unified the different laws of motion during the
physics the industrial revolution as energy needs increased so did research which led to the discovery of new laws in thermodynamics chemistry
physics chemistry and electromagnetics modern physics started with the works of max planck in quantum theory and einstein in relativity and continued
physics continued in quantum mechanics pioneered by heisenberg schr dinger and paul dirac n many ways physics stems from ancient greek philosophy
physics philosophy from thales first attempt to characterize matter to democritus deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state the
physics the ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament and aristotle s book physics an early book on physics which attempted to analyze
physics analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view various greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature physics was
physics was known as natural philosophy until the late th century by the th century physics was realized as a discipline distinct
physics distinct from philosophy and the other sciences physics as with the rest of science relies on philosophy of science to give
physics give an adequate description of the scientific method the scientific method employs a priori reasoning as well as a posteriori reasoning
physics reasoning and the use of bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory the development of physics has answered
physics answered many questions of early philosophers but has also raised new questions study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics the philosophy
physics philosophy of physics involves issues such as the nature of space and time determinism and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism naturalism
physics naturalism and realism many physicists have about the philosophical implications of their work for instance laplace who championed causal determinism and
physics and erwin schr dinger who wrote on quantum mechanics the mathematical physicist roger penrose has been called a platonist by stephen
physics stephen hawking a view penrose discusses in his book the road to reality hawking refers to himself as an unashamed reductionist
physics reductionist and issue with penrose s views though physics deals with a wide variety of systems certain theories are used by
physics by all physicists each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of nature within
physics within a certain domain of validity for instance the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects provided they
physics they are much larger than atoms and moving at much less than the speed of light these theories continue to be
physics be areas of active research and a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as chaos was discovered in the th century
physics century three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by isaac newton these central theories are important tools for research
physics research into more specialized topics and any physicist regardless of his or her specialization is expected to be literate in them
physics them these include classical mechanics quantum mechanics thermodynamics and statistical mechanics electromagnetism and special relativity classical physics main article classical physics
physics physics classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognized and well developed before the beginning of the th
physics th century classical mechanics acoustics optics thermodynamics and electromagnetism classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies
physics bodies in motion and may be divided into statics study of the forces on a body or bodies at rest kinematics
physics kinematics study of motion without regard to its causes and dynamics study of motion and the forces that affect it mechanics
physics mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics known together as continuum mechanics the latter including such branches
physics branches as hydrostatics hydrodynamics aerodynamics and pneumatics acoustics the study of sound is often considered a branch of mechanics because sound
physics sound is due to the motions of the particles of air or other medium through which sound waves can travel and
physics and thus can be explained in terms of the laws of mechanics among the important modern branches of acoustics is ultrasonics
physics ultrasonics the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing optics the study of light
physics light is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation which exhibit all of the phenomena
physics phenomena of visible light except visibility e g reflection refraction interference diffraction dispersion and polarization of light heat is a form
physics form of energy the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed thermodynamics deals with the relationships
physics relationships between heat and other forms of energy electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since
physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early th century an electric current gives rise to a magnetic
physics magnetic field and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest electrodynamics with moving
physics moving charges and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal
physics normal scale of observation while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions
physics conditions or on the very large or very small scale for example atomic and nuclear physics studies matter on the smallest
physics smallest scale at which chemical elements can be identified the physics of elementary particles is on an even smaller scale as
physics as it is concerned with the most basic units of matter this branch of physics is also known as high energy
physics energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in large particle accelerators on this
physics this scale ordinary commonsense notions of space time matter and energy are no longer valid the two chief theories of modern
physics modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space time and matter from that presented by classical physics quantum
physics quantum theory is concerned with the discrete rather than continuous nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and
physics and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena the theory of relativity is concerned
physics concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to
physics to an observer the special theory of relativity is concerned with relative uniform motion in a straight line and the general
physics general theory of relativity with accelerated motion and its connection with gravitation both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find
physics find applications in all areas of modern physics while physics aims to discover universal laws its theories lie in explicit domains
physics domains of applicability loosely speaking the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the
physics the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light outside of this domain observations do not
physics not match their predictions albert einstein contributed the framework of special relativity which replaced notions of absolute time and space with
physics with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light max planck erwin
physics erwin schr dinger and others introduced quantum mechanics a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of
physics of atomic and subatomic scales later quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity general relativity allowed for a dynamical
physics dynamical curved spacetime with which highly massive systems and the large scale structure of the universe can be well described general
physics general relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed
physics developed mathematics is the language used for compact description of the order in nature especially the laws of physics this was
physics was noted and advocated by pythagoras plato galileo and newton physics theories use mathematics to obtain order and provide precise formulas
physics formulas precise or d solutions quantitative results and predictions experiment results in physics are numerical measurements technologies based on mathematics like
physics like computation have made computational physics an active area of research the distinction between mathematics and physics is clear cut but
physics but not always obvious especially in mathematical physics ontology is a prerequisite for physics but not for mathematics it means physics
physics physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns even beyond the real
physics real world thus physics statements are synthetic while math statements are analytic mathematics contains hypotheses while physics contains theories mathematics statements
physics statements have to be only logically true while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data the distinction is
physics is clear cut but not always obvious for example mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics its methods are
physics are mathematical but its subject is physical the problems in this field start with a math model of a physical situation
physics situation and a math description of a physical law every math statement used for solution has a hard to find physical
physics physical meaning the final mathematical solution has an easier to find meaning because it is what the solver is looking for
physics for physics is a branch of fundamental science not practical science physics is also called the fundamental science because the subject
physics subject of study of all branches of natural science like chemistry astronomy geology and biology are constrained by laws of physics
physics physics for example chemistry studies properties structures and reactions of matter chemistry s focus on the atomic scale distinguishes it from
physics from physics structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other properties include physical characteristics of given substances and
physics and reactions are bound by laws of physics like conservation of energy mass and charge physics is applied in industries like
physics like engineering and medicine applied physics is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular use an
physics an applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline like geology or electrical engineering it usually differs
physics differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular but rather is using physics or
physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem the approach is similar to that
physics that of applied mathematics applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research for instance people
physics people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics physics is used heavily
physics heavily in engineering for example statics a subfield of mechanics is used in the building of bridges and other structures the
physics the understanding and use of acoustics results in better concert halls similarly the use of optics creates better optical devices an
physics an understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators video games and movies and is often critical in forensic investigations
physics investigations with the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time physics can be
physics be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty for example in the study of the origin of
physics of the earth one can reasonably model earth s mass temperature and rate of rotation over time it also allows for
physics for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology but there is also considerable interdisciplinarity in
physics in the physicist s methods and so many other important fields are influenced by physics e g the fields of econophysics
physics econophysics and sociophysics research scientific method physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory using a
physics a methodical approach to compare the implications of the theory in question with the associated conclusions drawn from experiments and observations
physics observations conducted to test it experiments and observations are collected and compared with the predictions and hypotheses made by a theory
physics theory thus aiding in the determination or the validity invalidity of the theory a scientific law is a concise verbal or
physics or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of a theory like newton s law of universal gravitation
physics gravitation theory and experiment theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results
physics results while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena although theory and experiment are developed
physics developed separately they are strongly dependent upon each other progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that
physics that existing theories cannot explain or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions which inspire new experiments physicists who work at
physics at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists phenomenologists look at the complex phenomena observed in experiment and work
physics work to relate them to fundamental theory theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy electromagnetism was unified this way beyond
physics beyond the known universe the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues such as parallel universes a multiverse and
physics and higher dimensions theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories they then explore the consequences
physics consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions experimental physics informs and is informed by engineering and technology experimental
physics experimental physicists involved in basic research design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers whereas those involved
physics involved in applied research often work in industry developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and transistors feynman has noted
physics noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well explored by theorists physics covers a wide range of phenomena from
physics from elementary particles such as quarks neutrinos and electrons to the largest superclusters of galaxies included in these phenomena are the
physics the most basic objects composing all other things therefore physics is sometimes called the fundamental science physics aims to describe the
physics the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena thus physics aims to both connect the things observable
physics observable to humans to root causes and then connect these causes together for example the ancient chinese observed that certain rocks
physics rocks lodestone were attracted to one another by some invisible force this effect was later called magnetism and was first rigorously
physics rigorously studied in the th century a little earlier than the chinese the ancient greeks knew of other objects such as
physics as amber that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two this was also first studied
physics studied rigorously in the th century and came to be called electricity thus physics had come to understand two observations of
physics of nature in terms of some root cause electricity and magnetism however further work in the th century revealed that these
physics these two forces were just two different aspects of one force electromagnetism this process of unifying forces continues today and electromagnetism
physics electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction physics hopes to find
physics find an ultimate reason theory of everything for why nature is as it is see section current research below for more

physics careers universalists such as albert einstein and lev landau who worked in multiple fields of physics are now very rare condensed
physics condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter in particular it is
physics is concerned with the condensed phases that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the
physics the interactions between them are strong the most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids which arise from the
physics the bonding and electromagnetic force between atoms more exotic condensed phases include the superfluid and the bose einstein condensate found in
physics in certain atomic systems at very low temperature the superconducting phase exhibited by conduction electrons in certain materials and the ferromagnetic
physics ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices condensed matter physics is by far the largest field of contemporary physics

physics observation of pattern formation in biological systems in horace lamb said the researchers developed a software engine called entropica and gave
physics gave it models of a number of situations in which it could demonstrate behaviors that greatly resemble intelligence they patterned many
physics many of these exercises after classic animal intelligence tests in one test the researchers presented entropica with a situation where it
physics it could use one item as a tool to remove another item from a bin and in another it could move
physics move a cart to balance a rod standing straight up in the air governed by simple principles of thermodynamics the software
physics software responded by displaying behavior similar to what people or animals might do all without being given a specific goal for
physics for any scenario it actually self determines what its own objective is said wissner gross this artificial intelligence does not require
physics require the explicit specification of a goal unlike essentially any other artificial intelligence entropica s intelligent behavior emerges from the physical
physics physical process of trying to capture as many future histories as possible said wissner gross future histories represent the complete set
physics set of possible future outcomes available to a system at any given moment wissner gross calls the concept at the center
physics center of the research causal entropic forces these forces are the motivation for intelligent behavior they encourage a system to preserve
physics preserve as many future histories as possible for example in the cart and rod exercise entropica controls the cart to keep
physics keep the rod upright allowing the rod to fall would drastically reduce the number of remaining future histories or in other
physics other words lower the entropy of the cart and rod system keeping the rod upright maximizes the entropy it maintains all
physics all future histories that can begin from that state including those that require the cart to let the rod fall the
physics the universe exists in the present state that it has right now it can go off in lots of different directions
physics directions my proposal is that intelligence is a process that attempts to capture future histories said wissner gross the research may
physics may have applications beyond what is typically considered artificial intelligence including language structure and social cooperation dedeo said it would be
physics be interesting to use this new framework to examine wikipedia and research whether it as a system exhibited the same behaviors

physics difference in jargon used in different fields wissner gross indicated that he expected to work closely with people in many fields
physics fields in the future in order to help them understand how their fields informed the new research and how the insights
physics insights might be useful in those fields the new research was inspired by cutting edge developments in many other disciplines some

physics be able to observe the universe advanced computer software can now compete with the best human players in chess and the
physics the strategy based game called go the researchers even drew from what is known as the cognitive niche theory which explains
physics explains how intelligence can become an ecological niche and thereby influence natural selection the proposal requires that a system be able
physics able to process information and predict future histories very quickly in order for it to exhibit intelligent behavior wissner gross suggested
physics suggested that the new findings fit well within an argument linking the origin of intelligence to natural selection and darwinian evolution
physics evolution that nothing besides the laws of nature are needed to explain intelligence although wissner gross suggested that he is confident
physics confident in the results he allowed that there is room for improvement such as incorporating principles of quantum physics into the
physics the framework additionally a company he founded is exploring commercial applications of the research in areas such as robotics economics and
physics and defense we basically view this as a grand unified theory of intelligence said wissner gross and i know that sounds

religion a book revealing his secret but can the frenchman do anything to cheer up our notoriously gloomy writer by robert chalmers
religion chalmers published february bring to your mind a past occasion of inner joy and happiness writes matthieu ricard in his new
religion new book happiness a guide to developing life s most important skill recall how you felt consider the lasting effect this
religion this experience has had on your mind and how it still nourishes a sense of fulfilment now this i tell ricard
religion ricard was the point where i started to run into trouble however long i worked at this meditation exercise the memory
religion memory that kept coming back to me was of the evening in may when i was sitting in the nou camp
religion camp in barcelona and ole gunnar solskjaer scored the injury time goal that won the champions league for manchester united i
religion i would suggest that what you experienced that night was elation and elation is not really what we mean by happiness
religion happiness it would be an interesting experiment for you to relive that night and assess what you actually gained from it
religion it you re right i tell him remembering how once the euphoria had worn off i was left contemplating the same
religion same void that has been described by countless sports fans from frederick exley author of the classic a fan s notes
religion notes to doug stanhope american comedian and er of the boston red sox when i woke up the next morning i
religion i tell him my head still ached i was still working for a magazine editor who loathed me and my laptop
religion laptop was still broken now that i come to think about it manchester united had done absolutely nothing for me because
religion because elation is a transient thing not true spiritual fulfilment but if i achieve spiritual fulfilment will i lose interest in
religion in going to old trafford absolutely not that s one of the mis people make that a serene balanced mind is
religion is a dull mind i love football matthieu ricard french translator and right hand man for the dalai lama has been
religion been the subject of intensive clinical tests at the university of wisconsin as a result of which he is frequently described
religion described as the happiest man in the world it s a somewhat flattering title he says given the tiny percentage of
religion of the global population who have had their brain patterns monitored by the same state of the art technology which involves
religion involves attaching sensors to the skull and three hours continuous mri scanning the fact remains that out of hundreds of volunteers
religion volunteers whose scores ranged from what you might call the morrissey zone to beatific the frenchman scored he shows me the
religion the chart of volunteers results on his laptop to find ricard you have to keep scrolling left away from the main
religion main curve until you eventually find him a remote dot at the beginning of the x axis it s true he
religion he concedes that i was well outside the normal parameters as a young man matthieu ricard was regarded as one of
religion of the most promising biologists of his generation he completed a starred phd at the institut pasteur under the supervision of
religion of nobel prize winner fran ccedil ois jacob but abandoned his scientific career in when he moved to darjeeling there he
religion he devoted himself to studying under kangyur rinpoche a tibetan master in the nyingma tradition the most ancient school of buddhism
religion buddhism he has been a monk and celibate since he was ricard still lives at the schechen monastery in nepal all
religion all proceeds from his books go to funding hospitals and schools in tibet which makes it feel barely appropriate that we
religion we should be meeting in a large apartment in the th arrondissement of paris an area roughly comparable to mayfair the
religion the monk explains that the flat sparsely decorated with tibetan artwork and pictures of the dalai lama belongs to a wealthy
religion wealthy philanthropist who has moved to the country before i met ricard who greeted me in his maroon robes i confess
religion confess to having harboured some scepticism about his good works but within minutes of speaking to him i can tell that
religion that the m mansion in malibu where he secretly retires to snort cocaine off the thighs of lithuanian hookers in the
religion the tradition of innumerable tv evangelists cannot conceivably exist in the foreword to happiness the psychologist dr daniel goleman describes how
religion how a three hour wait at an airport sped by in minutes due to the sheer pleasure of matthieu s orbit
religion orbit a phrase which had made me faintly nauseous when i first read it now it seems to make perfect sense
religion sense ricard exudes a sense of tranquillity kindness and surprisingly enough humour versatility has been the keynote in his life an
religion an outstanding goalkeeper in his youth matthieu ricard also enjoys an international reputation as a photographer and was lauded by cartier
religion cartier bresson he shows me pictures he s taken of the idyllic view from his hermitage having myself been described by
religion by private eye as journaliste mis eacute rable harshly i think given that of the negative emotions described in buddhist teaching
religion teaching there are at least a dozen that i haven t yet experienced i feel obliged to concede to ricard that
religion that i may have something to learn from him on the other hand i ask the monk how hard is it
religion it to be happy when you live on a mountainside with breathtaking views of the himalayas where your only concern is
religion is polishing your wind chimes what if you had my life living in the shadow of the new arsenal stadium the
religion the streets crowded with vengeful cockney van drivers the supermarkets staffed by cashiers who pass on the oppression of their wretched
religion wretched existence by drumming their fingers and flinging goods down the checkout at a speed that would have tested peter schmeichel
religion schmeichel in his prime not that i m saying you d be any happier where i grew up in manchester where
religion where two of my three uncles have been fired at with uzis what ricard interrupts is an uzi it s a
religion a machine gun ah the monk pauses i understand what you re saying i believe that if i had to live
religion live where you live i could by choice i would not move there but if you allow exterior circumstances to determine
religion determine your state of mind then of course you will suffer you become like a sponge or like a chameleon i
religion i have lived in difficult areas i lived in old delhi for almost a year that really is a miserable place
religion place and yet sometimes i felt so light there it was like how can i put this different weather happiness is
religion is a remarkable book untainted by the pretentious tone of many works that offer life enhancing advice even if one of
religion of the reviews quoted on its first page praises matthieu ricard for locating the chambers of the mind where serenity resides
religion resides in the wardrobe of my soul i can hear the late vivian stanshall singing in the section labelled shirts developing
religion developing happiness ricard argues is a skill most people exist like beggars unaware of the treasure buried beneath their shack we
religion we can develop our potential as if polishing a nugget and eventually omega achieve happiness like a bird soaring into the
religion the sky when his cage is opened ricard s book exudes inspiration and intelligence qualities embodied in its author even so
religion so i tell him one line that resonates with me is a quotation from the critic dominique noguez who argues that
religion that misery is more interesting than contentment because it has a seductive intensity and the attraction of always leaving something to
religion to anticipate happiness what other things ricard asks now make you happy i don t know a half case of jaboulet
religion jaboulet s parall egrave le c ocirc tes du rh ocirc ne with friends over prawn dhansak what you re describing
religion describing is a lull a calm in the storm you have to identify what it is in that situation that makes
religion makes you happy it s as though you re making a journey and you look in your rucksack to find it
religion it half filled with provisions half with stones you need to take out the stones and put in more provisions more
religion more wine no what i m saying is that these interludes of alcohol or physical exercise give a hint of what
religion what life could be like if you changed the balance of your mind instead of altering external circumstances a laboratory rat
religion rat he says given access to a pleasure bar that stimulates euphoria in the brain will keep pressing the lever until
religion until it dies of starvation ricard is a highly unusual figure in that by contrast with the unquestioning some would say
religion say credulous nature of many believers he has brought the scientific rigour of his early life to his faith first in
religion in the form of his translations of texts from tibetan the language in which he normally communicates then more recently in
religion in his contribution to the question of whether science can accurately map an individual s mental equilibrium he was assessed in
religion in a programme headed by the cognitive scientist professor richard k davidson principal of the laboratory for affective neuroscience at the
religion the university of wisconsin madison davidson is one of the world s leading investigators in the field of neuroplasticity the comparatively
religion comparatively recent discovery that the brain is constantly evolving in response to experience and that such evolution can be represented in
religion in a scan then quantified the relationship between the left and right cortex of the brain can be measured says ricard
religion ricard and the relationship between them faithfully represents the subject s temperament heightened activity on the left he says is associated
religion associated with pleasant emotions bias to the right indicates negativity and depression in these tests he explains all the meditators were
religion were outside the standard curve statistically they fell into in a tight well defined group even though they came from different
religion different backgrounds a tibetan nomad a young french boy an academic they all came in a cluster that s the point
religion point if it was just me it could have been a fluke isn t there an inherited predisposition to gloom it
religion it s true that a difference in mental balance can be demonstrated in children aged two so now you re going
religion going to ask what s the point it s this the important thing with mind training probably a more useful term
religion term than meditation is that you change your own base line this is very different from the temporary sensation of feeling
religion feeling good that you might experience when you watch a marx brothers film what you have to do is raise that
religion that base line matthieu ricard was born into a family that could hardly have been better connected his mother yahne le
religion le toumelin who has become a buddhist nun herself is an abstract artist praised by andr eacute breton in his study
religion study surrealism and painting his father jean fran ccedil ois revel who died last year was one of france s most
religion most celebrated philosophical authors and journalists matthieu attended the private parisian lyc eacute e janson de sailly fellow alumni include jean
religion jean gabin valerie giscard d estaing and lionel jospin he was when he first had lunch with stravinsky his father was
religion was less than delighted when matthieu influenced by films on tibetan buddhism made by his friend arnaud desjardins abandoned his studies
religion studies and left for india in father and son published a series of dialogues the monk and the philosopher which sold
religion sold almost copies in france and is one of the most brilliantly informative works of modern philosophy ever happiness a more
religion more accessible book contains simple exercises designed to help the reader achieve the same sort of composure that radiates from ricard
religion ricard himself anger he says is a destructive emotion which reduces us to puppets have you never lost it occasionally ricard
religion ricard says in the s i got my first laptop i used it to translate tibetan texts a friend tossed flour
religion flour on to the keyboard as a joke when he saw i was really angry he said one moment of anger
religion anger can destroy years of patience psychological studies ricard argues contradict the notion that giving free rein to the emotions relieves
religion relieves bottled up tension staying with laptop rage i tell him i had an apple that was constantly crashing in the
religion the end i took it into the back garden and kicked it to pieces like my friend ralph steadman who recently
religion recently put a pickaxe through his fax machine i explain i felt much better for it then with my next laptop
religion laptop a toshiba whose screen was forever whiting out i tried to do the right thing i posted it with a
religion a civil letter to mr walker at toshiba s pr company he never returned the machine or replied to my subsequent
religion subsequent correspondence this has left me subject to feelings of real loathing towards mr walker which can surface at any time
religion time of the night or day are you absolutely sure that mindless vandalism can never be good i think this is
religion is an example where cognitive therapy could be very good for you ricard replies your problem is that you imagine mr
religion mr walker had something against you personally the truth is that he had omega nothing against you at all he was
religion was probably overworked if something is not going to happen you have to leave it at peace let it go i
religion i know you had another laptop stolen not so long ago when you were travelling in india i didn t feel
religion feel aggrieved at all ricard says adding that his only regret was that he hadn t been able to send the
religion the thief the power lead but where does such passivity lead i ask ricard in less trivial circumstances let s say
religion say for the sake of argument i continue that you live in a country governed by a man who has betrayed
religion betrayed every principle he ever professed to believe in who habitually lies who has sent innocent citizens to die in illegal
religion illegal combat he wouldn t choose to engage in himself and who accepts the hospitality of at least one world leader
religion leader who is shamelessly corrupt what s the correct response to that behaviour to expose it says ricard it s important
religion important to have a desire for honesty and truth but in a practical way not through hatred to take a well
religion well worn example if you d found yourself armed and alone in a room with hitler at berchtesgaden in i d
religion d have shot him certainly if there was no other way because it would have alleviated greater suffering somebody once asked
religion asked the dalai lama what he d do if someone came in wanting to murder everyone in the room he replied
religion replied i d begin by shooting at his legs if that didn t work i d move up to his head
religion head he has a sense of irony then he does does he watch the marx brothers too he doesn t have
religion have to his life is so full of humour although i think he used to watch mash my own limited knowledge
religion knowledge of buddhism i tell ricard relates to the life of chogyam trungpa who was one of allen ginsberg s mentors
religion mentors trungpa who died of cirrhosis in aged was responsible for helping to popularise the religion in britain a notorious alcoholic
religion alcoholic and philanderer whose spiritual reputation suffered a public setback when drunk at the wheel of his sports car he crashed
religion crashed into a joke shop on the outskirts of dumfries just as christianity is symbolised by the crucifixion for me until
religion until now just the mention of buddhism has evoked the image of a robed figure lying semi conscious among pieces of
religion of dashboard whoopee cushions and chattering teeth trungpa was extremely unconventional as you suggest he never tried to hide his behaviour
religion behaviour i never met him i would not take him as my teacher the fundamentally unconfrontational philosophy of buddhism ricard says
religion says will triumph in the end if you have a society of selfish people combined one to one with altruistic people
religion people theoretically the altruists should be wiped out but altruists can co operate which gives them a strong advantage that is
religion is the cause of hope hope s the right word because i don t see the world getting any better it
religion it may look that way on the news ricard replies but every serious study indicates a decrease in the number of
religion of deaths in armed conflict at the time of napoleon the spanish took french soldiers and nailed them between planks it
religion it was the most terrible death fair enough but they were french they were ricard extinguishes the hint of a smile
religion smile the point is that i do believe there is an increased tendency towards compassion in baghdad every conflict has its
religion its source in hatred once the forest is on fire you re not dealing with how to extinguish the spark of
religion of course you can t go and teach meditation in the midst of genocide say but in the future perhaps we
religion we can shift people s thinking to discourage such developments people don t blow themselves up for no reason changes of
religion of mind build slowly out of discontent greed and neglect these things have to be addressed before hatred is fully blown
religion blown like the dalai lama himself ricard says he is an ardent er of the bbc world service and bbc news
religion news and yet watching live reportage is hardly conducive to happiness when i ask ricard it s a question which as
religion as i confess to him makes me squirm slightly but i don t think it s irrelevant in this context did
religion did he last weep i cried recently because of what was it i remember it was an item on the television
religion television news about people who had suffered a lot i believe it had to do with abuse i cried for a
religion a long time we talk for two or three hours into the early evening i m struck by how much better
religion better known ricard might have become had he applied his wit to his father s trade in philosophy and journalism and
religion and how much more impressive he d have been than france s best known contemporary intellectual bernard henri l eacute vy
religion vy l eacute vy who has proved more susceptible than most to the charm of his own ego recently claimed to
religion to have developed stigmata and last year received his seventh cream pie in the face from the belgian n ouml el
religion el godin who has made it his life s work to subvert the immaculately preened thinker as it is there s
religion s only one moment in our conversation when ricard risks his karma by addressing current affairs in a waspish spirit it
religion it happens when i ask him if he has even been tempted to write political articles i have because you turn
religion turn on the radio and you hear jeb bush saying he is suspending capital punishment for a because it took one
religion one man minutes to die and then you hear socialist presidential candidate s eacute gol egrave ne royal say i admire
religion admire chinese justice because it is swift well she s right there for sure says ricard who has spent much of
religion of his life attempting to repair the consequences of that nation s brutal assaults on tibet chinese justice it s swift
religion swift by the time i leave he has persuaded me of the benefits to be gained from forgiving my enemies and
religion and i think i can forgive them with the possible exceptions of mr walker and that bouncer at the borderline and
religion and yet i tell him i know that in terms of happiness my nugget remains unpolished my bird still caged and
religion and as for the treasure buried under my shack i m not even sure i remember where my shack is apart
religion apart from working with the meditation exercises in happiness what should i do next there s a programme called mbsr mindfulness
religion mindfulness based stress reduction developed by jon kabat zinn at massachusetts university they have produced a range of excellent tapes but
religion but ultimately it s how your mind relates to the world that determines whether you re miserable or not you have
religion have to ask yourself is my happiness dependent on other people it s dark by the time i leave ricard s
religion s borrowed apartment walking back into the streets of the city feels like re entering another reality a bit like coming
religion coming out of a cinema to find that night has fallen i have an appointment with a french journalist friend at

religion was viewed as a pariah by the whole village they demanded that he take care of the child since it was
religion was his responsibility quot is that so quot hakuin said calmly as he accepted the child for many s he took
religion took very good care of the child until the daughter could no longer withstand the lie she had told she confessed
religion confessed that the real father was a young man in the village whom she had tried to protect the parents immediately
religion immediately went to hakuin to see if he would return the baby with profuse apologies they explained what had happened quot

religion aspect of life it does not want us to neglect either since matter is spirit in manifestation adhyatma ramayana sage chandramas
religion chandramas expounds the philosophy of the atman self to sampati because man thinks of his body as himself karma becomes operative
religion operative this i sense which binds one to the body is beginningless and is a result of ignorance in itself it
religion it is inert without consciousness but being in association with the reflection of pure consciousness it appears conscious just as a
religion a red hot piece of iron appears hot and shining in association with fire because the body is in identification with
religion with this i sense the body too appears to be endowed with consciousness dominated by the i sense the atman embodied
religion embodied soul thinks of himself as the body and becomes subject to the cycle of births and deaths and to the
religion the consequent experience of happiness and misery the atman it itself is changeless but because of this false identification he thinks
religion thinks i am the body and i am the doer of various actions thus the embodied being becomes the performer of
religion of many actions and is helplessly bound by their consequences he finds himself fettered and wanders hither and thither in this
religion this trans migratory cycle as a victim of sinful and meritorious actions the master key to understanding the bhagavad gita from

religion sutra badarayana vyasa strings together the leading concepts of vedanta in an ordered manner the sutra is an exquisite garland made
religion made out of upanishad blossoms it is divided into four chapters adhyayas each chapter consists of four parts padas each part
religion part has a number of sections adhikaranas and each section has one or more aphorisms sutras grand religion sect after sect
religion sect arose in india and seemed to shake the religion of the vedas to its very foundations but like the waters
religion waters of the seashore in a tremendous earthquake it receded only for a while only to return in an all absorbing
religion absorbing flood a thousand times more vigorous and when the tumult of the rush was over these sects were all sucked
religion sucked in absorbed and assimilated into the immense body of the bear the little burden of this life rdquo thus sang
religion sang the rishis of the vedas and how to worship him through love ldquo he is to be worshipped as the
religion the one beloved dearer than everything in this and the next life rdquo this is the doctrine of love declared in
religion in the vedas and let us see how it is fully developed and taught by krishna whom the hindus believe to
religion to have been god incarnate on earth he taught that a man ought to live in this world like a lotus
religion lotus leaf which grows in water but is never moistened by water so a man ought to live in the world
religion world mdash his heart to god and his hands to work it is good to love god for hope of reward
religion reward in this or the next world but it is better to love god for love rsquo s sake and the
religion the prayer goes ldquo lord i do not want wealth nor children nor learning if it be thy will i shall
religion shall go from birth to birth but grant me this that i may love thee without the hope of reward mdash
religion mdash love unselfishly for love rsquo s sake rdquo one of the disciples of krishna the then emperor of india was
religion was driven from his kingdom by his enemies and had to take shelter with his queen in a forest in the
religion the himalayas and there one day the queen asked him how it was that he the most virtuous of men should
religion should suffer so much misery yudhishthira answered ldquo behold my queen the himalayas how grand and beautiful they are i love
religion love them they do not give me anything but my nature is to love the grand the beautiful therefore i love
religion love them similarly i love the lord he is the source of all beauty of all sublimity he is the only
religion only object to be loved my nature is to love him and therefore i love i do not pray for anything
religion anything i do not ask for anything let him place me wherever he likes i must love him for love rsquo
religion rsquo s sake i cannot trade in love rdquo the vedas teach that the soul is divine only held in the
religion the bondage of matter perfection will be reached when this bond will burst and the word they use for it is
religion is therefore mukti mdash freedom freedom from the bonds of imperfection freedom from death and misery and this bondage can only
religion only fall off through the mercy of god and this mercy comes on the pure so purity is the condition of
religion of his mercy how does that mercy act he reveals himself to the pure heart the pure and the stainless see
religion see god yea even in this life then and then only all the crookedness of the heart is made straight then
religion then all doubt ceases he is no more the freak of a terrible law of causation this is the very centre
religion centre the very vital conception of hinduism the hindu does not want to live upon words and theories if there are
religion are existences beyond the ordinary sensuous existence he wants to come face to face with them if there is a soul
religion soul in him which is not matter if there is an all merciful universal soul he will go to him direct
religion direct he must see him and that alone can destroy all doubts so the best proof a hindu sage gives about
religion about the soul about god is ldquo i have seen the soul i have seen god rdquo and that is the
religion the only condition of perfection the hindu religion does not consist in struggles and attempts to believe a certain doctrine or
religion or dogma but in realising mdash not in believing but in being and becoming thus the whole object of their system
religion system is by constant struggle to become perfect to become divine to reach god and see god and this reaching god
religion god seeing god becoming perfect even as the father in heaven is perfect constitutes the religion of the hindus and what
religion what becomes of a man when he attains perfection he lives a life of bliss infinite he enjoys infinite and perfect
religion perfect bliss having obtained the only thing in which man ought to have pleasure namely god and enjoys the bliss with
religion with god so far all the hindus are agreed this is the common religion of all the sects of india but
religion but then perfection is absolute and the absolute cannot be two or three it cannot have any qualities it cannot be
religion be an individual and so when a soul becomes perfect and absolute it must become one with brahman and it would
religion would only realise the lord as the perfection the reality of its own nature and existence the existence absolute knowledge absolute
religion absolute and bliss absolute we have often and often read this called the losing of individuality and becoming a stock or
religion or a stone ldquo he jests at scars that never felt a wound rdquo i tell you it is nothing of
religion of the kind if it is happiness to enjoy the consciousness of this small body it must be greater happiness to
religion to enjoy the consciousness of two bodies the measure of happiness increasing with the consciousness of an increasing number of bodies
religion bodies the aim the ultimate of happiness being reached when it would become a universal consciousness therefore to gain this infinite
religion infinite universal individuality this miserable little prison individuality must go then alone can death cease when i am alone with life
religion life then alone can misery cease when i am one with happiness itself then alone can all errors cease when i
religion i am one with knowledge itself and this is the necessary scientific conclusion science has proved to me that physical individuality
religion individuality is a delusion that really my body is one little continuously changing body in an unbroken ocean of matter and
religion and advaita unity is the necessary conclusion with my other counterpart soul science is nothing but the finding of unity as
religion as soon as science would reach perfect unity it would stop from further progress because it would reach the goal thus
religion thus chemistry could not progress farther when it would discover one element out of which all other could be made physics
religion physics would stop when it would be able to fulfill its services in discovering one energy of which all others are
religion are but manifestations and the science of religion become perfect when it would discover him who is the one life in
religion in a universe of death him who is the constant basis of an ever changing world one who is the only
religion only soul of which all souls are but delusive manifestations thus is it through multiplicity and duality that the ultimate unity
religion unity is reached religion can go no farther this is the goal of all science all science is bound to come
religion come to this conclusion in the long run manifestation and not creation is the word of science today and the hindu
religion hindu is only glad that what he has been cherishing in his bosom for ages is going to be taught in
religion in more forcible language and with further light from the latest conclusions of science descend we now from the aspirations of
religion of philosophy to the religion of the ignorant at the very outset i may tell you that there is no polytheism
religion polytheism in india in every temple if one stands by and listens one will find the worshippers applying all the attributes
religion attributes of god including omnipresence to the images it is not polytheism nor would the name henotheism explain the situation ldquo
religion ldquo the rose called by any other name would smell as sweet rdquo names are not explanations i remember as a

religion s religion which muhammad revived and reformed after making certain additions the emulation of muhammad s example and authentic hadith reports
religion reports originating from the companions of muhammad started from the ninth century earlier sources however reflect a more flexible use of

religion this concept continued in shi a islam in which shi ite imams are also a source of sunnah malik ibn anas
religion anas author of al muwatta the earliest extant manual of islamic law used sunnah but treated the existing practice of the

religion the first islamic civil war of the th century those receiving the hadith began to question the sources of the saying
religion saying citation needed verification needed this resulted in a chain of transmission for example a told me that b told him
religion him that muhammad said the hadith were eventually recorded in form with their chain of transmission recorded and were collected into
religion into large collections mostly during the reign of umar ii during th century something that solidified in the th century these
religion these works are still today referred to in matters of islamic law and history western academics view the hadith collections with

religion several generations after muhammad s death and that during that period the opportunities and motives for falsification were almost unlimited in
religion in addition to the problem of oral transmission for over a hundred years there existed motives for deliberate distortion early muslim
religion muslim scholars were also concerned that hadiths may have been fabricated and thus developed a whole science of criticism to distinguish
religion distinguish between genuine sayings and those that were errors or frauds modern historians point out that a chain of authorities may
religion may be easily forged and that rejection of some relators implies the victory of one thought over the others hadith is
religion is considered an authoritative source of revelation second only to the qur an in islamic jurisprudence the qur an contains many
religion many rules for the behavior expected of muslims however there are many matters of concern both religious and practical on which

religion their rites but they too maintain the concept of divine authority in the th and early th centuries there was a

religion groups within judaism orthodox jews see orthodox judaism who form the majority assert the supreme authority of the torah and adhere
religion adhere to all the traditions of judaism including the strict dietary laws see kosher and the segregation of women in the
religion the synagogue reform judaism rejects the idea that jews are the chosen people has a liberal interpretation of the dietary laws
religion laws and a questioning attitude towards the torah conservative judaism is a compromise between orthodox and reform in its acceptance of
religion of the traditional law making some allowances for modern conditions although its services and ceremonies are closer to orthodox than to
religion to reform liberal judaism or reconstructionism goes further than reform in attempting to adapt judaism to the needs of the modern
religion modern world and to interpret the torah in the light of current scholarship in all the groups except orthodox women are
religion are not segregated in the synagogue and there are female rabbis in both reform and liberal judaism many people who call

religion define a jew as in other religions fundamentalist movements have emerged for example gush emunim jewish denominations main article jewish denominations
religion denominations over the past two centuries the jewish community has divided into a number of jewish denominations each has a different
religion different understanding of what principles of belief a jew should hold and how one should live as a jew to some

religion for example it would not be unusual for a conservative jew to attend either an orthodox or reform synagogue the article
religion article on relationships between jewish religious movements discusses how different jewish denominations view each other hasidic jews are one part of
religion of the haredi community the most theologically conservative form of judaism pictured here hasidic rebbes orthodox judaism holds that both the

religion judaism of the temple in jerusalem pre enlightenment rabbinic judaism and modern day orthodox judaism most of orthodox judaism holds to
religion to one particular form of jewish theology based on maimonides principles of jewish faith orthodox judaism broadly and informally shades into
religion into two main styles modern orthodox judaism and haredi judaism the philosophical distinction is generally around accommodation to modernity and weight
religion weight placed on non jewish disciplines though in practical terms the differences are often reflected in styles of dress and rigor

religion there are a number of haredi jewish groups who like modern orthodoxy accept modernization including ers of torah im derech eretz
religion eretz and perhaps most notably lubavitch hassidism the modern culture is seen as a means to worship god instead of an
religion an end unto itself many orthodox jews do not look at one s professed denomination alone as the principal way of
religion of evaluating religious level instead they view jews by how closely their beliefs and practices accord with orthodox ones hasidic judaism
religion judaism is a form of orthodox judaism based on the teachings of rabbi israel ben eliezer the baal shem tov hassidic
religion hassidic philosophy is rooted in the kabbalah and hassidic jews accept the kabbalah as sacred scripture they are distinguished both by
religion by a variety of special customs and practices including reliance on a rebbe or supreme religious leader and for a special
religion special dress code particular to each hassidic group conservative judaism known as masorti judaism outside of the united states and canada

religion the enlightenment and jewish emancipation it is characterized by a commitment to ing traditional jewish laws and customs including observance of
religion of shabbat and kashrut a deliberately non fundamentalist teaching of jewish principles of faith a positive attitude toward modern culture an
religion an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic modes of study and modern scholarship and critical text study when considering jewish religious texts
religion texts it teaches that jewish law was not static but rather has always developed in response to changing conditions it holds
religion holds that the torah is a divine document by prophets inspired by god but rejects the orthodox position that it was
religion was dictated by god to moses similarly conservative judaism holds that judaism s oral law is divine and normative but rejects
religion rejects some orthodox interpretations of the oral law accordingly conservative judaism holds that both the and oral law may be interpreted
religion interpreted by the rabbinnate to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions although great caution should be exercised in doing so
religion so progressive judaism is composed of multiple movements in several countries reform judaism called liberal or progressive in many countries originally
religion originally formed in germany in response to the enlightenment note that in the united kingdom there are two distinct congregational unions
religion unions reform and liberal the former is significantly more traditional than the latter but both hold to essentially the same theoretical
religion theoretical position its defining characteristic with respect to the other movements is its rejection of the binding nature of jewish ceremonial
religion ceremonial law as such and instead believing that individual jews should exercise an informed autonomy about what to observe reform judaism
religion judaism initially defined judaism as a religion rather than as a race or culture rejected most of the ritual ceremonial laws
religion laws of the torah while observing moral laws and emphasized the ethical call of the prophets reform judaism developed a prayer
religion prayer service in the vernacular along with hebrew in most cases and emphasized personal connection to jewish tradition over specific forms
religion forms of observance today many reform congregations encourage the study of hebrew and traditional observances in reform judaism prayer is often
