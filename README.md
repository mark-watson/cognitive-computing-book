# Examples for "Introduction to Cognitive Computing. A Guide for Individuals and Small Organizations"

This git repository contains the examples for my short book [Introduction to Cognitive Computing](https://leanpub.com/cognitive-computing/)

## Notes for second edition released November 2018

Several small corrections.

I updated Tensorflow to version 1.11.0 and I removed some material that I no longer considered to be relevant.
