__label__chemistry the term chymistry in the view of noted scientist robert boyle in meant the subject of the material principles of mixed
__label__chemistry mixed bodies in chymistry meant a scientific art by which one learns to dissolve bodies and draw from them the different
__label__chemistry different substances on their composition and how to unite them again and exalt them to a higher perfection this definition was
__label__chemistry was used by chemist christopher glaser the definition of the word chemistry as used by georg ernst stahl meant the art
__label__chemistry art of resolving mixed compound or aggregate bodies into their principles and of composing such bodies from those principles in jean
__label__chemistry jean baptiste dumas considered the word chemistry to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces
__label__chemistry forces this definition further evolved until in it came to mean the science of substances their structure their properties and the
__label__chemistry the reactions that change them into other substances a characterization accepted by linus pauling more recently in the definition of chemistry
__label__chemistry chemistry was broadened to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes as phrased by professor raymond chang the

__label__chemistry by a space called the electron cloud the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and neutrons that have no
__label__chemistry no charge while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus in a neutral atom the negatively

__label__chemistry of chemical elements the colors represent different categories of elements main article chemical element the concept of chemical element is related
__label__chemistry related to that of chemical substance a chemical element is specifically a pure substance which is composed of a single type
__label__chemistry type of atom a chemical element is characterized by a particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms this
__label__chemistry this number is known as the atomic number of the element for example all atoms with protons in their nuclei are
__label__chemistry are atoms of the chemical element carbon and all atoms with protons in their nuclei are atoms of the element uranium
__label__chemistry uranium although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same number of protons they may
__label__chemistry may not necessarily have the same number of neutrons such atoms are termed isotopes in fact several isotopes of an element
__label__chemistry element may exist ninety four different chemical elements or types of atoms based on the number of protons are observed on
__label__chemistry on earth naturally having at least one isotope that is stable or has a very long half life a further elements
__label__chemistry elements have been recognised by iupac after they have been made in the laboratory the standard presentation of the chemical elements
__label__chemistry elements is in the periodic table which orders elements by atomic number and groups them by electron configuration due to its
__label__chemistry its arrangement groups or columns and periods or rows of elements in the table either share several chemical properties or a
__label__chemistry a certain trend in characteristics such as atomic radius electronegativity etc lists of the elements by name by symbol and by
__label__chemistry by atomic number are also available a compound is a pure chemical substance that consists of two or more elements combined
__label__chemistry combined together in a compound there is a particular ratio of atoms of particular chemical elements which determines its composition and
__label__chemistry and a particular organization which determines its chemical properties for example water is a compound containing hydrogen and oxygen in the
__label__chemistry the ratio of two to one with the oxygen atom between the two hydrogen atoms and an angle of between them
__label__chemistry them compounds are formed and interconverted by chemical reactions a chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition
__label__chemistry composition and set of properties strictly speaking a mixture of compounds elements or compounds and elements is not a chemical substance
__label__chemistry substance but it may be called a chemical most of the substances we encounter in our daily life are some kind
__label__chemistry kind of mixture for example air alloys biomass etc nomenclature of substances is a critical part of the language of chemistry
__label__chemistry chemistry generally it refers to a system for naming chemical compounds earlier in the history of chemistry substances were given name
__label__chemistry name by their discoverer which often led to some confusion and difficulty however today the iupac system of chemical nomenclature allows
__label__chemistry allows chemists to specify by name specific compounds amongst the vast variety of possible chemicals the standard nomenclature of chemical substances
__label__chemistry substances is set by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac there are well defined systems in place for
__label__chemistry for naming chemical species organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system inorganic compounds are named according to the
__label__chemistry the inorganic nomenclature system in addition the chemical abstracts service has devised a method to index chemical substances in this scheme
__label__chemistry scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its cas registry number a molecule is the smallest indivisible
__label__chemistry indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties that is its potential to undergo
__label__chemistry undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances however this definition only works well for substances that are composed
__label__chemistry composed of molecules which is not true of many substances see below molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together
__label__chemistry together by covalent bonds such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either
__label__chemistry either in bonds or in lone pairs thus molecules exist as electrically neutral units unlike ions when this rule is broken
__label__chemistry broken giving the molecule a charge the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion however the discrete
__label__chemistry discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well separated form such
__label__chemistry such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrograph charged polyatomic collections residing in solids for example common
__label__chemistry common sulfate or nitrate ions are generally not considered molecules in chemistry a d skeletal model of a benzene molecule c
__label__chemistry c h the inert or noble gas elements helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon are composed of lone atoms as
__label__chemistry as their smallest discrete unit but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to
__label__chemistry to each other in some way identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water air and many organic compounds like alcohol
__label__chemistry alcohol sugar gasoline and the various pharmaceuticals however not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules and indeed most
__label__chemistry most of the solid substances that makes up the solid crust mantle and core of the earth are chemical compounds without
__label__chemistry without molecules these other types of substances such as ionic compounds and network solids are organized in such a way as
__label__chemistry as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se instead these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or
__label__chemistry or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance examples of such substances are mineral salts such as table
__label__chemistry table salt solids like carbon and diamond metals and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite one of
__label__chemistry of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure while the structure of diatomic triatomic or
__label__chemistry or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial linear angular pyramidal etc the structure of polyatomic molecules that are constituted of more
__label__chemistry more than six atoms of several elements can be crucial for its chemical nature mole and amount of substance main article
__label__chemistry article mole unit the mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance also called chemical amount specifically
__label__chemistry specifically it is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities atoms molecules or ions as there are
__label__chemistry are atoms in kilogram or grams of carbon where the carbon atoms are unbound at rest and in their ground state
__label__chemistry state the number of entities per mole is known as the avogadro constant and is determined empirically the currently accepted value
__label__chemistry value is mol codata one way to understand the meaning of the term mole is to compare and contrast it to
__label__chemistry to terms such as dozen just as one dozen eggs contains individual eggs one mole contains atoms molecules or other particles
__label__chemistry particles the term is used because it is much easier to say for example mole of carbon than it is to
__label__chemistry to say carbon atoms and because moles of chemicals represent a scale that is easy to experience the amount of substance
__label__chemistry substance of a solute per volume of is known as amount of substance concentration or molarity for short molarity is the
__label__chemistry the quantity most commonly used to express the concentration of a solution in the chemical laboratory the most commonly used units
__label__chemistry units for molarity are mol l the official si units are mol m properties ions and salts the crystal lattice structure

__label__chemistry to some potential these potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals in many simple compounds valence
__label__chemistry valence bond theory the valence shell electron pair repulsion model vsepr and the concept of oxidation number can be used to
__label__chemistry to explain molecular structure and composition an ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons
__label__chemistry electrons becoming a positively charged cation and the electrons are then gained by the non metal atom becoming a negatively charged
__label__chemistry charged anion the two oppositely charged ions attract one another and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between

__label__chemistry or with energy a chemical reaction is said to have occurred a chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the
__label__chemistry the reaction of a substance when it comes in close contact with another whether as a mixture or a solution exposure
__label__chemistry exposure to some form of energy or both it results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as
__label__chemistry as well with the system environment which may be designed vessels which are often laboratory glassware chemical reactions can result in
__label__chemistry in the formation or dissociation of molecules that is molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules or rearrangement
__label__chemistry rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds oxidation reduction dissociation
__label__chemistry dissociation acid base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions a chemical reaction can
__label__chemistry can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation while in a non nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms
__label__chemistry atoms on both sides of the equation are equal for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles
__label__chemistry particles viz protons and neutrons the sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in
__label__chemistry in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism a chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in
__label__chemistry in a number of steps each of which may have a different speed many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus
__label__chemistry thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product
__label__chemistry product mix of a reaction many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions several empirical
__label__chemistry empirical rules like the woodward hoffmann rules often come handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction according to the
__label__chemistry the iupac gold book a chemical reaction is a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species accordingly a chemical
__label__chemistry chemical reaction may be an elementary reaction or a stepwise reaction an additional caveat is made in that this definition includes
__label__chemistry includes cases where the interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as
__label__chemistry as indicated by this definition but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular
__label__chemistry molecular entities i e microscopic chemical events redox main article redox redox reduction oxidation reactions include all chemical reactions in which
__label__chemistry which atoms have their oxidation state changed by either gaining electrons reduction or losing electrons oxidation substances that have the ability
__label__chemistry ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing agents oxidants or oxidizers an oxidant
__label__chemistry oxidant removes electrons from another substance similarly substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive
__label__chemistry reductive and are known as reducing agents reductants or reducers a reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus oxidized
__label__chemistry oxidized itself and because it donates electrons it is also called an electron donor oxidation and reduction properly refer to a
__label__chemistry a change in oxidation number the actual transfer of electrons may never occur thus oxidation is better defined as an increase
__label__chemistry increase in oxidation number and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number equilibrium main article chemical equilibrium although the concept of
__label__chemistry of equilibrium is widely used across sciences in the context of chemistry it arises whenever a number of different states of
__label__chemistry of the chemical composition are possible for example in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another
__label__chemistry another or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase a system of chemical substances at
__label__chemistry at equilibrium even though having an unchanging composition is most often not static molecules of the substances continue to react with
__label__chemistry with one another thus giving rise to a dynamic equilibrium thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such
__label__chemistry such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time energy main article energy in the context of chemistry energy is an attribute
__label__chemistry attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic molecular or aggregate structure since a chemical transformation is accompanied by
__label__chemistry by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease
__label__chemistry decrease of energy of the substances involved some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in
__label__chemistry in the form of heat or light thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the
__label__chemistry the reactants a reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the
__label__chemistry the initial state in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse a reaction is said to be exothermic
__label__chemistry exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings in the case of endothermic reactions the reaction absorbs heat from the
__label__chemistry the surroundings chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy the
__label__chemistry the speed of a chemical reaction at given temperature t is related to the activation energy e by the boltzmann s
__label__chemistry s population factor e e kt that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to
__label__chemistry to e at the given temperature t this exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the arrhenius
__label__chemistry arrhenius equation the activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat light electricity
__label__chemistry electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound a related concept free energy which also incorporates entropy considerations is a
__label__chemistry a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction
__label__chemistry reaction in chemical thermodynamics a reaction is feasible only if the total change in the gibbs free energy is negative delta
__label__chemistry delta g le if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at equilibrium there exist only
__label__chemistry only limited possible states of energy for electrons atoms and molecules these are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics which
__label__chemistry which require quantization of energy of a bound system the atoms molecules in a higher energy state are said to be
__label__chemistry be excited the molecules atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive that is more amenable
__label__chemistry amenable to chemical reactions the phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings
__label__chemistry surroundings when the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome
__label__chemistry overcome them it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water h o
__label__chemistry o a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds whereas hydrogen sulfide h s is a
__label__chemistry a gas at room temperature and standard pressure as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole dipole interactions the transfer of
__label__chemistry of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance however heat
__label__chemistry heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational
__label__chemistry rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer thus because vibrational
__label__chemistry vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels heat is more easily transferred between substances relative
__label__chemistry relative to light or other forms of electronic energy for example ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy
__label__chemistry efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy the existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances
__label__chemistry substances is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral lines different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical

__label__chemistry concepts of equilibrium thermodynamics and kinetics law of conservation of mass continues to be conserved in isolated systems even in modern
__label__chemistry modern physics however special relativity shows that due to mass energy equivalence whenever non material energy heat light kinetic energy is
__label__chemistry is removed from a non isolated system some mass will be lost with it high energy losses result in loss of
__label__chemistry of weighable amounts of mass an important topic in nuclear chemistry law of definite composition although in many systems notably biomacromolecules

__label__computers model scanned the scene and based on its supervised training recognized the objects in the scene the upshot is that the
__label__computers the model learned from examples which according to poggio is a hallmark of artificial intelligence modeling object recognition teaching a computer
__label__computers computer how to recognize objects has been exceedingly difficult because a computer model has two paradoxical goals it needs to create
__label__computers create a representation for a particular object that is very specific such as a horse as opposed to a cow or
__label__computers or a unicorn at the same time the representation must be sufficiently invariant so as to discard meaningless changes in pose
__label__computers pose illumination size position and many other variations in appearances even a child s brain handles these contradictory tasks easily in
__label__computers in rapid object recognition pixel like information enters from the retina and passes in a fast feed forward bottom up sweep
__label__computers sweep through the hierarchical architecture of the visual cortex what makes the poggio lab s model so innovative and powerful is
__label__computers is that computationally speaking it mimics the brain s own hierarchy specifically the layers within the model replicate the way neurons
__label__computers neurons process input and output stimuli according to neural recordings in physiological labs like the brain the model alternates several times
__label__computers times between computations that help build an object representation that is increasingly invariant to changes in appearances of an object in
__label__computers in the visual field and computations that help build an object representation that is increasingly complex and specific to a given
__label__computers given object the model s success validates work in physiology labs that have measured the tuning properties of neurons throughout visual
__label__computers visual cortex by necessity most of those experiments are made with simplistic artificial stimuli such as gratings bars and line drawings
__label__computers drawings that bear little resemblance to real world images we put together a system that mimics as closely as possible how
__label__computers how cortical cells respond to simple stimuli like the ones that are used in the physiology lab said serre the fact
__label__computers fact that this system seems to work on realistic street scene images is a concept proof that the activity of neurons
__label__computers neurons as measured in the lab is sufficient to explain how brains can perform complex recognition tasks making it more useful
__label__computers useful the model used in the street scene application mimics only the computations the brain uses for rapid object recognition the
__label__computers the lab is now elaborating the model to include the brain s feedback loops from the cognitive centers this slower form

__label__computers a truth we all suspected we have some people at google who are really trying to build artificial intelligence ai and

__label__computers that far away either the term googlebot is about to take on a whole new meaning and in the not to
__label__computers to distant future as well but google is a good company you may well say after all do no evil is
__label__computers is the company mantra but true artificial intelligence not only has serious ethical and moral implications self aware intelligence may also
__label__computers also not be controllable after all it thinks for itself and makes decisions based on that reasoning as we all do
__label__computers do what if google creates ai with the logical reasoning neuroscientists at mit have developed a computer model that mimics the
__label__computers the human vision system to accurately detect and recognize objects in a busy street scene such as cars and motorcycles such
__label__computers such biologically inspired vision systems could soon be used in surveillance systems or in smart sensors that can warn drivers of
__label__computers of pedestrians and other obstacles it may also help in the development of so called visual search engines says thomas serre
__label__computers serre a neuroscientist at the center for biological and computational learning at mit s mcgovern institute for brain research who was
__label__computers was involved in the project researchers have been interested for years in trying to copy biological vision systems simply because they
__label__computers they are so good says david hogg a computer vision expert at leeds university in the uk this is a very
__label__computers very successful example of mimicking biological vision he says teaching a computer to classify objects has proved much harder than was
__label__computers was originally anticipated says serre who carried out the work with tomaso poggio codirector of the center on the one hand
__label__computers hand to recognize a particular type of object such as a car a computer needs a template or computational representation specific
__label__computers specific to that particular object such a template enables the computer to distinguish a car from objects in other classes noncars
__label__computers noncars yet this representation must be sufficiently flexible to include all types of cars no matter how varied in appearance at
__label__computers at different angles positions and poses and under different lighting conditions you want to be able to recognize an object anywhere
__label__computers anywhere in the field of vision irrespective of where it is and irrespective of its size says serre yet if you
__label__computers you analyze images just by their patterns of light and dark pixels then two portrait images of different people can end
__label__computers end up looking more similar than two images of the same person taken from different angles the most effective method for
__label__computers for getting around such problems is to train a learning algorithm on a set of images and allow it to extract
__label__computers extract the features they have in common two wheels aligned with the road could signal a car for example serre and
__label__computers and poggio believe that the human vision system uses a similar approach but one that depends on a hierarchy of successive
__label__computers successive layers in the visual cortex the first layers of the cortex detect an object s simpler features such as edges
__label__computers edges and higher layers integrate that information to form our perception of the object as a whole artificial intelligence wikipedia the

__label__computers the technology industry the success was due to several factors the incredible power of computers today see moore s law a
__label__computers a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems the creation of new ties between ai and other fields working on similar problems
__label__computers problems and above all a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards artificial intelligence by claiming
__label__computers claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy
__label__computers philosophy are there limits to how intelligent machines can be is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence
__label__computers intelligence can a machine have a mind and consciousness a few of the most influential answers to these questions are given
__label__computers given below turing s polite convention if a machine acts as intelligently as a human being then it is as intelligent
__label__computers intelligent as a human being alan turing theorized that ultimately we can only judge the intelligence of a machine based on
__label__computers on its behavior this theory forms the basis of the turing test the dartmouth proposal every aspect of learning or any
__label__computers any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it this assertion
__label__computers assertion was printed in the proposal for the dartmouth conference of and represents the position of most working ai researchers newell
__label__computers newell and simon s physical symbol system hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent
__label__computers intelligent action this statement claims that the essence of intelligence is symbol manipulation hubert dreyfus argued that on the contrary human
__label__computers human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than
__label__computers than explicit symbolic knowledge g del s incompleteness theorem a formal system such as a computer program can not prove all
__label__computers all true statements roger penrose is among those who claim that g del s theorem limits what machines can do searle
__label__computers searle s strong ai hypothesis the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in
__label__computers in exactly the same sense human beings have minds searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which asks us
__label__computers us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be the artificial brain argument the brain
__label__computers brain can be simulated hans moravec ray kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain
__label__computers brain directly into hardware and software and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original ai research in
__label__computers in the st century ai research has become highly specialized and technical deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate
__label__computers communicate with each other subfields have grown up around particular institutions the work of individual researchers the solution of specific problems
__label__computers problems longstanding differences of opinion about how ai should be done and the application of widely differing tools deduction reasoning problem
__label__computers problem solving early ai researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step by step reasoning that human beings use when they solve
__label__computers solve puzzles play board games or make logical deductions by the late s and s ai research had also developed highly
__label__computers highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics for difficult problems most of
__label__computers of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources most experience a combinatorial explosion the amount of memory or computer time required
__label__computers required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size the search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a
__label__computers a high priority for ai research human beings solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments rather than the conscious
__label__computers conscious step by step deduction that early ai research was able to model ai has made some progress at imitating this
__label__computers this kind of sub symbolic problem solving embodied approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning neural net research
__label__computers research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that gives rise to this skill knowledge representation main articles
__label__computers articles knowledge representation and commonsense knowledge knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central to ai research many of the problems machines
__label__computers machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world among the things that ai needs to represent are
__label__computers are objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we
__label__computers we know about what other people know and many other less well researched domains a complete representation of what exists is
__label__computers is an ontology borrowing a word from traditional philosophy of which the most general are called upper ontologies among the most
__label__computers most difficult problems in knowledge representation are default reasoning and the qualification problem many of the things people know take the
__label__computers the form of working assumptions for example if a bird comes up in conversation people typically picture an animal that is
__label__computers is fist sized sings and flies none of these things is true about all birds john mccarthy identified this problem in
__label__computers in as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge
__label__computers huge number of exceptions almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires ai research has
__label__computers has explored a number of solutions to this problem the breadth of commonsense knowledge the number of atomic facts that the
__label__computers the average person knows is astronomical research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge e g
__label__computers g cyc require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time
__label__computers time a major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources
__label__computers sources like the internet and thus be able to add to its own ontology the subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge
__label__computers knowledge much of what people know isn t represented as facts or statements that they could actually say out loud for
__label__computers for example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed or an art critic can
__label__computers can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake these are intuitions or tendencies that
__label__computers that are represented in the brain non consciously and sub symbolically knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for
__label__computers for symbolic conscious knowledge as with the related problem of sub symbolic reasoning it is hoped that situated ai or computational
__label__computers computational intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge planning main article automated planning and scheduling intelligent agents must
__label__computers must be able to set goals and achieve them they need a way to visualize the future they must have a
__label__computers a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it
__label__computers it and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of the available choices in some planning problems
__label__computers problems the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what
__label__computers what the consequences of its actions may be however if this is not true it must periodically check if the world

__label__computers concept at a time knowledge based ai when computers with large memories became available around researchers from all three traditions began
__label__computers began to build knowledge into ai applications this knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of expert systems introduced by
__label__computers by edward feigenbaum the first truly successful form of ai software the knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that
__label__computers that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple ai applications sub symbolic ai during the s symbolic approaches
__label__computers approaches had achieved great success at simulating high level thinking in small demonstration programs approaches based on cybernetics or neural networks
__label__computers networks were abandoned or pushed into the background by the s however progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many
__label__computers many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning
__label__computers learning and pattern recognition a number of researchers began to look into sub symbolic approaches to specific ai problems bottom up
__label__computers up embodied situated behavior based or nouvelle ai researchers from the related field of robotics such as rodney brooks rejected symbolic
__label__computers symbolic ai and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive their work revived the
__label__computers the non symbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the s and reintroduced the use of control theory in ai
__label__computers ai these approaches are also conceptually related to the embodied mind thesis computational intelligence interest in neural networks and connectionism was

__label__computers intelligent agent paradigm an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and actions which maximizes its chances of success
__label__computers success the simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems the most complicated intelligent agents are rational thinking human beings

__label__computers agreeing on one single approach an agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works some agents are
__label__computers are symbolic and logical some are sub symbolic neural networks and others may use new approaches the paradigm also gives researchers
__label__computers researchers a common language to communicate with other fields such as decision theory and economics that also use concepts of abstract
__label__computers abstract agents the intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the s an agent architecture or cognitive architecture researchers have designed
__label__computers designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi agent system a system with both symbolic
__label__computers symbolic and sub symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system and the study of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration
__label__computers integration a hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub symbolic ai at its lowest reactive levels and traditional symbolic ai
__label__computers ai at its highest levels where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling rodney brooks subsumption architecture was an early
__label__computers early proposal for such a hierarchical system tools of ai research in the course of years of research ai has developed
__label__computers developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science a few of the most general
__label__computers general of these methods are discussed below search and optimization main articles search algorithm optimization mathematics and evolutionary computation many problems
__label__computers problems in ai can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions reasoning can be reduced to performing
__label__computers performing a search for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions
__label__computers conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting
__label__computers attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called means ends analysis robotics algorithms for moving limbs and
__label__computers and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization simple exhaustive searches
__label__computers searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to
__label__computers to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes the solution for many problems is
__label__computers is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal called pruning
__label__computers pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with a best guess for what path the solution lies on a very
__label__computers very different kind of search came to prominence in the s based on the mathematical theory of optimization for many problems
__label__computers problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until
__label__computers until no more refinements can be made these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at
__label__computers at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we
__label__computers we reach the top other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization evolutionary computation uses a form of
__label__computers of optimization search for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate
__label__computers mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses forms of evolutionary computation include swarm intelligence
__label__computers intelligence algorithms such as ant colony or particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms and genetic logic main
__label__computers main articles logic and automated reasoning logic was introduced into ai research by john mccarthy in his advice taker proposal in
__label__computers in j alan robinson discovered a simple complete and entirely algorithmic method for logical deduction which can easily be performed by
__label__computers by digital computers however a naive implementation of the algorithm quickly leads to a combinatorial explosion or an infinite loop in
__label__computers in robert kowalski suggested representing logical expressions as horn clauses statements in the form of rules if p then q which
__label__computers which reduced logical deduction to backward chaining or forward chaining this greatly alleviated but did not eliminate the problem logic is
__label__computers is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well for example the
__label__computers the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and inductive logic is a method for learning there are several different forms of
__label__computers of logic used in ai research propositional or sentential logic is the logic of statements which can be true or false
__label__computers false first order logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and
__label__computers and their relations with each other fuzzy logic a version of first order logic which allows the truth of a statement
__label__computers statement to be represented as a value between and rather than simply true or false fuzzy systems can be used for
__label__computers for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems default logics non monotonic logics

__label__computers applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up controllers do

__label__computers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match they can be tuned according to examples making them very
__label__computers very attractive for use in ai these examples are known as observations or patterns in supervised learning each pattern belongs to
__label__computers to a certain predefined class a class can be seen as a decision that has to be made all the observations
__label__computers observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is
__label__computers is classified based on previous experience a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning
__label__computers learning approaches a wide range of classifiers are available each with its strengths and weaknesses classifier performance depends greatly on the
__label__computers the characteristics of the data to be classified there is no single classifier that works best on all given problems this
__label__computers this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem various empirical tests have been performed to compare classifier performance
__label__computers performance and to find the characteristics of data that determine classifier performance determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is
__label__computers is however still more an art than science the most widely used classifiers are the neural network kernel methods such as

__label__computers agent is intelligent in alan turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the
__label__computers the turing test this procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested however it is a
__label__computers a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as
__label__computers as small problems in chemistry hand writing recognition and game playing such tests have been termed subject matter expert turing tests

__label__computers ai if one were to rank a list of civilization s greatest and most elusive intellectual challenges the problem of decoding
__label__computers decoding ourselves understanding the inner workings of our minds and our brains and how the architecture of these elements is encoded
__label__computers encoded in our genome would surely be at the top yet the diverse fields that took on this challenge from philosophy
__label__computers philosophy and psychology to computer science and neuroscience have been fraught with disagreement about the right approach in the computer scientist
__label__computers scientist john mccarthy coined the term artificial intelligence ai to describe the study of intelligence by implementing its essential features on
__label__computers on a computer instantiating an intelligent system using man made hardware rather than our own biological hardware of cells and tissues
__label__computers tissues would show ultimate understanding and have obvious practical applications in the creation of intelligent devices or even robots some of
__label__computers of mccarthy s colleagues in neighboring departments however were more interested in how intelligence is implemented in humans and other animals
__label__computers animals first noam chomsky and others worked on what became cognitive science a field aimed at uncovering the mental representations and
__label__computers and rules that underlie our perceptual and cognitive abilities chomsky and his colleagues had to overthrow the then dominant paradigm of
__label__computers of behaviorism championed by harvard psychologist b f skinner where animal behavior was reduced to a simple set of associations between
__label__computers between an action and its subsequent reward or punishment the undoing of skinner s grip on psychology is commonly marked by
__label__computers by chomsky s critical review of skinner s book verbal behavior a book in which skinner attempted to explain linguistic ability
__label__computers ability using behaviorist principles skinner s approach stressed the historical associations between a stimulus and the animal s response an approach
__label__computers approach easily framed as a kind of empirical statistical analysis predicting the future as a function of the past chomsky s
__label__computers s conception of language on the other hand stressed the complexity of internal representations encoded in the genome and their maturation
__label__computers maturation in light of the right data into a sophisticated computational system one that cannot be usefully broken down into a
__label__computers a set of associations behaviorist principles of associations could not explain the richness of linguistic knowledge our endlessly creative use of
__label__computers of it or how quickly children acquire it with only minimal and imperfect exposure to language presented by their environment the
__label__computers the language faculty as chomsky referred to it was part of the organism s genetic endowment much like the visual system
__label__computers system the immune system and the circulatory system and we ought to approach it just as we approach these other more
__label__computers more down to earth biological systems david marr a neuroscientist colleague of chomsky s at mit defined a general framework for
__label__computers for studying complex biological systems like the brain in his influential book vision one that chomsky s analysis of the language
__label__computers language capacity more or less fits into according to marr a complex biological system can be understood at three distinct levels
__label__computers levels the first level computational level describes the input and output to the system which define the task the system is
__label__computers is performing in the case of the visual system the input might be the image projected on our retina and the
__label__computers the output might our brain s identification of the objects present in the image we had observed the second level algorithmic
__label__computers algorithmic level describes the procedure by which an input is converted to an output i e how the image on our
__label__computers our retina can be processed to achieve the task described by the computational level finally the third level implementation level describes
__label__computers describes how our own biological hardware of cells implements the procedure described by the algorithmic level the approach taken by chomsky
__label__computers chomsky and marr toward understanding how our minds achieve what they do is as different as can be from behaviorism the
__label__computers the emphasis here is on the internal structure of the system that enables it to perform a task rather than on
__label__computers on external association between past behavior of the system and the environment the goal is to dig into the black box
__label__computers box that drives the system and describe its inner workings much like how a computer scientist would explain how a cleverly
__label__computers cleverly designed piece of software works and how it can be executed on a desktop computer as today the history of
__label__computers of cognitive science is a story of the unequivocal triumph of an essentially chomskyian approach over skinner s behaviorist paradigm an
__label__computers an achievement commonly referred to as the cognitive revolution though chomsky himself rejects this term while this may be a relatively
__label__computers relatively accurate depiction in cognitive science and psychology behaviorist thinking is far from dead in related disciplines behaviorist experimental paradigms and
__label__computers and associationist explanations for animal behavior are used routinely by neuroscientists who aim to study the neurobiology of behavior in laboratory
__label__computers laboratory animals such as rodents where the systematic three level framework advocated by marr is not applied in may of last
__label__computers last year during the th anniversary of the massachusetts institute of technology a symposium on brains minds and machines took place
__label__computers place where leading computer scientists psychologists and neuroscientists gathered to discuss the past and future of artificial intelligence and its connection
__label__computers connection to the neurosciences the gathering was meant to inspire multidisciplinary enthusiasm for the revival of the scientific question from which
__label__computers which the field of artificial intelligence originated how does intelligence work how does our brain give rise to our cognitive abilities
__label__computers abilities and could this ever be implemented in a machine noam chomsky speaking in the symposium wasn t so enthused chomsky
__label__computers chomsky critiqued the field of ai for adopting an approach reminiscent of behaviorism except in more modern computationally sophisticated form chomsky
__label__computers chomsky argued that the field s heavy use of statistical techniques to pick regularities in masses of data is unlikely to
__label__computers to yield the explanatory insight that science ought to offer for chomsky the new ai focused on using statistical learning techniques
__label__computers techniques to better mine and predict data is unlikely to yield general principles about the nature of intelligent beings or about
__label__computers about cognition this critique sparked an elaborate reply to chomsky from google s director of research and noted ai researcher peter
__label__computers peter norvig who defended the use of statistical models and argued that ai s new methods and definition of progress is
__label__computers is not far off from what happens in the other sciences chomsky acknowledged that the statistical approach might have practical value
__label__computers value just as in the example of a useful search engine and is enabled by the advent of fast computers capable
__label__computers capable of processing massive data but as far as a science goes chomsky would argue it is inadequate or more harshly
__label__computers harshly kind of shallow we wouldn t have taught the computer much about what the phrase physicist sir isaac newton really
__label__computers really means even if we can build a search engine that returns sensible hits to users who type the phrase in
__label__computers in artificial intelligence ai would be the possession of intelligence or the exercise of thought by machines such as computers philosophically
__label__computers philosophically the main ai question is can there be such or as alan turing put it can a machine think what
__label__computers what makes this a philosophical and not just a scientific and technical question is the scientific recalcitrance of the concept of
__label__computers of intelligence or thought and its moral religious and legal significance in european and other traditions moral and legal standing depend
__label__computers depend not just on what is outwardly done but also on inward states of mind only rational individuals have standing as
__label__computers as moral agents and status as moral patients subject to certain harms such as being betrayed only sentient individuals are subject
__label__computers subject to certain other harms such as pain and suffering since computers give every outward appearance of performing intellectual tasks the
__label__computers the question arises are they really thinking and if they are really thinking are they not then owed similar rights to
__label__computers to rational human beings many fictional explorations of ai in literature and film explore these very questions a complication arises if
__label__computers if humans are animals and if animals are themselves machines as scientific biology supposes still we wish to exclude from the
__label__computers the machines in question men born in the usual manner alan turing or even in unusual manners such as in vitro
__label__computers vitro fertilization or ectogenesis and if nonhuman animals think we wish to exclude them from the machines too more particularly the
__label__computers the ai thesis should be understood to hold that thought or intelligence can be produced by artificial means made not grown
__label__computers grown for brevity s sake we will take machine to denote just the artificial ones since the present interest in thinking
__label__computers thinking machines has been aroused by a particular kind of machine an electronic computer or digital computer present controversies regarding claims
__label__computers claims of artificial intelligence center on these accordingly the scientific discipline and engineering enterprise of ai has been characterized as the
__label__computers the attempt to discover and implement the computational means to make machines behave in ways that would be called intelligent if
__label__computers if a human were so behaving john mccarthy or to make them do things that would require intelligence if done by
__label__computers by men marvin minsky these standard formulations duck the question of whether deeds which indicate intelligence when done by humans truly
__label__computers truly indicate it when done by machines that s the philosophical question so called weak ai grants the fact or prospect
__label__computers prospect of intelligent acting machines strong ai says these actions can be real intelligence strong ai says some artificial computation is
__label__computers is thought computationalism says that all thought is computation though many strong ai advocates are computationalists these are logically independent claims
__label__computers claims some artificial computation being thought is consistent with some thought not being computation contra computationalism all thought being computation is
__label__computers is consistent with some computation and perhaps all artificial computation not being thought the turing test while we don t know
__label__computers know what thought or intelligence is essentially and while we re very far from agreed on what things do and don
__label__computers don t have it almost everyone agrees that humans think and agrees with descartes that our intelligence is amply manifest in
__label__computers in our speech along these lines alan turing suggested that if computers showed human level conversational abilities we should by that
__label__computers that be amply assured of their intelligence turing proposed a specific conversational test for human level intelligence the turing test it
__label__computers it has come to be called turing himself characterizes this test in terms of an imitation game turing p whose original
__label__computers original version is played by three people a man a a woman b and an interrogator c who may be of
__label__computers of either sex the interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two the object of the game for the
__label__computers the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman the interrogator is
__label__computers is allowed to put questions to a and b by teletype to avoid visual and auditory clues it is a s
__label__computers s object in the game to try and cause c to make the wrong identification the object of the game for
__label__computers for the third player b is to help the interrogator turing continues we may now ask the question what will happen
__label__computers happen when a machine the part of a in this game will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game
__label__computers game is being played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman these

__label__computers and machine learning is one the focus areas of the office if you might be interested feel welcome to send me
__label__computers me email awm google com we are also accepting applications for google interns from cs ee stats departments in summer the
__label__computers the ing links point to a set of tutorials on many aspects of statistical data mining including the foundations of probability
__label__computers probability the foundations of statistical data analysis and most of the classic machine learning and data mining algorithms these include classification
__label__computers classification algorithms such as decision trees neural nets bayesian classifiers support vector machines and cased based aka non parametric learning they
__label__computers they include regression algorithms such as multivariate polynomial regression mars locally weighted regression gmdh and neural nets and they include other
__label__computers other data mining operations such as clustering mixture models k means and hierarchical bayesian networks and reinforcement learning i hope they
__label__computers they re useful and please let me know if they are or if you have suggestions or error corrections click here
__label__computers here for a short list of topics decision trees the decision tree is one of the most popular classification algorithms in
__label__computers in current use in data mining and machine learning this tutorial can be used as a self contained introduction to the
__label__computers the flavor and terminology of data mining without needing to review many statistical or probabilistic pre requisites if you re new
__label__computers new to data mining you ll enjoy it but your eyebrows will raise at how simple it all is after having
__label__computers having defined the job of classification we explain how information gain next andrew tutorial can be used to find predictive input
__label__computers input attributes we show how applying this procedure recursively allows us to build a decision tree to predict future events we
__label__computers we then look carefully at a question so fundamental it is the basis for much of all statistics and machine learning
__label__computers learning theory how do you choose between a complicated model that fits the data really well and an occam s razor
__label__computers razor model that is succinct yet not so good at fitting data this topic will be revisited in later andrew lectures
__label__computers lectures including cross validation and vc dimension we also discuss the very wide world of improvements and tweaks on the basic
__label__computers basic decision tree idea information gain this tutorial steps through the ideas from information theory that eventually lead to information gain
__label__computers gain one of the most popular measures of association currently used in data mining we visit the ideas of entropy and
__label__computers and conditional entropy along the way look at the lecture on gaussians for discussion of entropy in the case of continuous
__label__computers continuous probability density functions probability for data miners this tutorial reviews probability starting right at ground level it is arguably a
__label__computers a useful investment to be completely happy with probability before venturing into advanced algorithms from data mining machine learning or applied
__label__computers applied statistics in addition to setting the stage for techniques to be used over and over again throughout the remaining tutorials
__label__computers tutorials this tutorial introduces the notion of density estimation as an important operation and then introduces bayesian classifiers such as the
__label__computers the overfitting prone joint density bayes classifier and the over fitting resistant naive bayes classifier probability density functions a review of
__label__computers of a world that you ve probably encountered before real valued random variables probability density functions and how to deal with
__label__computers with multivariate i e high dimensional probablity densities here s where you can review things like expectations covariance matrices independence marginal
__label__computers marginal distributions and conditional distributions once you re happy with this stuff you won t be a data miner but you
__label__computers you ll have the tools to very quickly become one gaussians gaussians both the friendly univariate kind and the slightly reticent
__label__computers reticent but nice when you get to know them multivariate kind are extremely useful in many parts of statistical data mining
__label__computers mining including many data mining models in which the underlying data assumption is highly non gaussian you need to be friend
__label__computers friend with multivariate gaussians maximum likelihood estimation mle is a solid tool for learning parameters of a data mining model it
__label__computers it is a methodlogy which tries to do two things first it is a reasonably well principled way to work out
__label__computers out what computation you should be doing when you want to learn some kinds of model from data second it is
__label__computers is often fairly computationally tractable in any case the important thing is that in order to understand things like polynomial regression
__label__computers regression neural nets mixture models hidden markov models and many other things it s going to really help if you re
__label__computers re happy with mle gaussian bayes classifiers once you are friends with gaussians it it easy to use them as subcomponents
__label__computers subcomponents of bayesian classifiers this tutorial show you how cross validation cross validation is one of several approaches to estimating how
__label__computers how well the model you ve just learned from some training data is going to perform on future as yet unseen
__label__computers unseen data we ll review testset validation leave one one cross validation loocv and k fold cross validation and we ll
__label__computers ll discuss a wide variety of places that these techniques can be used we ll also discuss overfitting the terrible phenomenon
__label__computers phenomenon that cv is supposed to present and at the end our hairs will stand on end as we realize that
__label__computers that even when using cv you can still overfit arbitrarily badly neural networks we begin by talking about linear regression the
__label__computers the ancestor of neural nets we look at how linear regression can use simple matrix operations to learn from data we
__label__computers we gurgle with delight as we see why one initial assumption leads inevitably to the decision to try to minimize sum
__label__computers sum squared error we then explore an alternative way to compute linear parameters gradient descent and then we exploit gradient descent
__label__computers descent to allow classifiers in addition to regressors and finally to allow highly non linear models full neural nets in all
__label__computers all their glory instance based learning aka case based or memory based or non parametric over a century old this form
__label__computers form of data mining is still being used very intensively by statisticians and machine learners alike we explore nearest neighbor learning
__label__computers learning k nearest neighbor kernel methods and locally weighted polynomial regression software and data for the algorithms in this tutorial are
__label__computers are available from http www cs cmu edu awm vizier the example figures in this slide set were created with the
__label__computers the same software and data eight regression algorithms you ll have to wait to find out andrew s ordering on them
__label__computers them but based on all the foundations you ve covered so far we will quickly be able to run through regression
__label__computers regression trees cascade correlation group method data handling gmdh multivariate adaptive regression splines mars multilinear interpolation radial basis functions robust regression
__label__computers regression cascade correlation projection pursuit predicting real valued outputs an introduction to regression this lecture is made up entirely from material
__label__computers material from the start of the neural nets lecture and a subset of the topics in the favorite regression algorithms lecture
__label__computers lecture we talk about linear regression and then these topics varying noise non linear regression very briefly polynomial regression radial basis
__label__computers basis functions robust regression regression trees multilinear interpolation and mars bayesian networks the tutorial first reviews the fundamentals of probability but
__label__computers but to do that properly please see the earlier andrew lectures on probability for data mining it then discusses the use
__label__computers use of joint distributions for representing and reasoning about uncertain knowledge having discussed the obvious drawback the curse of dimensionality for
__label__computers for joint distributions as a general tool we visit the world of clever tricks involving indepedence and conditional independence that allow
__label__computers allow us to express our uncertain knowledge much more succinctly and then we beam with pleasure as we realize we ve
__label__computers ve got most of the knowledge we need to understand and appreciate bayesian networks already the remainder of the tutorial introduces
__label__computers introduces the important question of how to do inference with bayesian networks see also the next andrew lecture for that inference
__label__computers inference in bayesian networks by scott davies and andrew moore the majority of these slides were conceived and created by scott
__label__computers scott davies scottd cs cmu edu once you ve got hold of a bayesian network there remains the question of how
__label__computers how you do inference with it inference is the operation in which some subset of the attributes are given to us
__label__computers us with known values and we must use the bayes net to the probability distribution of one or more of the
__label__computers the remaining attributes a typical use of inference is i ve got a temperature of i m a year old male
__label__computers male and my tongue feels kind of funny but i have no headache what s the chance that i ve got
__label__computers got bubonic plague learning bayesian networks this short and simple tutorial overviews the problem of learning bayesian networks from data and
__label__computers and the approaches that are used this is an area of active research by many research group including andrew and his
__label__computers his students see the auton lab website for more details a short intro to naive bayesian classifiers i recommend using probability
__label__computers probability for data mining for a more in depth introduction to density estimation and general use of bayes classifiers with naive
__label__computers naive bayes classifiers as a special case but if you just want the executive summary bottom line on learning and using
__label__computers using naive bayes classifiers on categorical attributes then these are the slides for you short overview of bayes nets this is
__label__computers is a very short minute executive overview of the intuition and insight behind bayesian networks read the full bayes net tutorial
__label__computers tutorial for more information gaussian mixture models gaussian mixture models gmms are among the most statistically mature methods for clustering though
__label__computers though they are also used intensively for density estimation in this tutorial we introduce the concept of clustering and see how
__label__computers how one form of clustering in which we assume that individual datapoints are generated by first choosing one of a set
__label__computers set of multivariate gaussians and then sampling from them can be a well defined computational operation we then see how to
__label__computers to learn such a thing from data and we discover that an optimization approach not used in any of the previous
__label__computers previous andrew tutorials can help considerably here this optimization method is called expectation maximization em we ll spend some time giving
__label__computers giving a few high level explanations and demonstrations of em which turns out to be valuable for many other algorithms beyond
__label__computers beyond gaussian mixture models we ll meet em again in the later andrew tutorial on hidden markov models the wild n
__label__computers n crazy algebra mentioned in the text can be found hand here k means and hierarchical clustering k means is the
__label__computers the most famous clustering algorithm in this tutorial we review just what it is that clustering is trying to achieve and
__label__computers and we show the detailed reason that the k means approach is cleverly optimizing something very meaningful oh yes and we
__label__computers we ll tell you and show you what the k means algorithm actually does you ll also learn about another famous
__label__computers famous class of clusterers hierarchical methods much beloved in the life sciences phrases like hierarchical agglomerative clustering and single linkage clustering
__label__computers clustering will be bandied about hidden markov models in this tutorial we ll begin by reviewing markov models aka markov chains
__label__computers chains and then we ll hide them this simulates a very common phenomenon there is some underlying dynamic system running along
__label__computers along according to simple and uncertain dynamics but we can t see it all we can see are some noisy signals
__label__computers signals arising from the underlying system from those noisy observations we want to do things like predict the most likely underlying
__label__computers underlying system state or the time history of states or the likelihood of the next observation this has applications in fault
__label__computers fault diagnosis robot localization computational biology speech understanding and many other areas in the tutorial we will describe how to happily
__label__computers happily play with the mostly harmless math surrounding hmms and how to use a heart warming and simple to implement approach
__label__computers approach called dynamic dp to efficiently do most of the hmm computations you could ever want to do these operations include
__label__computers include state estimation estimating the most likely path of underlying states and and a grand and em filled finale learning hmms
__label__computers hmms from data vc dimension this tutorial concerns a well known piece of machine learning theory if you ve got a
__label__computers a learning algorithm in one hand and a dataset in the other hand to what extent can you decide whether the
__label__computers the learning algorithm is in danger of overfitting or underfitting if you want to put some formal analysis into the fascinating
__label__computers fascinating question of how overfitting can happen then this is the tutorial for you in addition to getting good understanding of
__label__computers of the overfitting phenomenon you also end up with a method for estimating how well an algorithm will perform on future
__label__computers future data that is solely based on its training set error and a property vc dimension of the learning algorithm vc
__label__computers vc dimension thus gives an alternative to cross validation called structural risk minimization srm for choosing classifiers we ll discuss that
__label__computers that we ll also very briefly compare both cv and srm to two other model selection methods aic and bic support
__label__computers support vector machines we review the idea of the margin of a classifier and why that may be a good criterion
__label__computers criterion for measuring a classifier s desirability then we consider the computational problem of finding the largest margin linear classifier at
__label__computers at this point we look at our toes with embarassment and note that we have only done work applicable to noise
__label__computers noise free data but we cheer up and show how to create a noise resistant classifier and then a non linear
__label__computers linear classifier we then look under a microscope at the two things svms are renowned for the computational ability to survive
__label__computers survive projecting data into a trillion dimensions and the statistical ability to survive what at first sight looks like a classic
__label__computers classic overfitting trap pac learning pac stands for probably approximately correct and concerns a nice formalism for deciding how much data
__label__computers data you need to collect in order for a given classifier to achieve a given probability of correct predictions on a
__label__computers a given fraction of future test data the resulting is somewhat conservative but still represents an interesting avenue by which computer
__label__computers computer science has tried to muscle in on the kind of analytical problem that you would normally find in a statistics
__label__computers statistics department markov decision processes how do you plan efficiently if the results of your actions are uncertain there is some
__label__computers some remarkably good news and some some significant computational hardship we begin by discussing markov systems which have no actions and
__label__computers and the notion of markov systems with rewards we then motivate and explain the idea of infinite horizon discounted future rewards
__label__computers rewards and then we look at two competing approaches to deal with the ing computational problem given a markov system with
__label__computers with rewards compute the expected long term discounted rewards the two methods which usually sit at opposite corners of the ring
__label__computers ring and snarl at each other are straight linear algebra and dynamic we then make the leap up to markov decision
__label__computers decision processes and find that we ve already done of the work needed to compute not only the long term rewards
__label__computers rewards of each mdp state but also the optimal action to take in each state in addition to these slides for
__label__computers for a survey on reinforcement learning please see this paper or sutton and barto s book visual simulation of markov decision
__label__computers decision process and reinforcement learning algorithms by rohit kelkar and vivek mehta reinforcement learning you need to be happy about markov
__label__computers markov decision processes the previous andrew tutorial before venturing into reinforcement learning it concerns the fascinating question of whether you can
__label__computers can train a controller to perform optimally in a world where it may be necessary to suck up some short term
__label__computers term punishment in order to achieve long term reward we will discuss certainty equivalent rl the temporal difference td learning and
__label__computers and finally q learning the curse of dimensionality will be constantly learning over our shoulder salivating and cackling in addition to

__label__computers finite deterministic games of perfect information we also practice saying that noun phrase in a single breath after the recovery teams
__label__computers teams have done their job we talk about solving such games with minimax and then alpha beta search we also discuss
__label__computers discuss the dynamic approach used most commonly for end games we also debate the theory and practice of heuristic evaluation functions

__label__computers as children rocks baseball cards barbies perhaps even bugs we all tried to gather up as much stuff as possible to
__label__computers to compile the biggest most interesting collection possible some of you may have even been able to amass a collection of
__label__computers of items numbering into the hundreds or thousands as the story always goes we got older our collections got smaller and
__label__computers and eventually our interests died out until now there are currently organizations around the world in the business of amassing collections
__label__computers collections of things and their collections number into and above the trillions in many cases these collections or databases consist of
__label__computers of items we use every day in this list we cover the top largest databases in the world library of not
__label__computers not even the digital age can prevent the world s largest library from ending up on this list the library of
__label__computers of lc boasts more than million items ranging from cook books to colonial newspapers to u s government proceedings it is
__label__computers is d that the text portion of the library of would comprise terabytes of data the lc expands at a rate
__label__computers rate of items per day and up close to miles of shelf space talk about a lengthy search for a book
__label__computers book if you re researching a topic and cannot find the right information on the internet the library of should be
__label__computers be your destination of choice for users researching u s history around million pieces from the lc s collection can be
__label__computers be found online at american memory unfortunately for us the library of has no plans of digitizing the entirety of its
__label__computers its contents and limits the people who can check out materials to supreme court justices members of their respective staff and
__label__computers and a select few other government officials however anyone with a valid reader identification card the lc s library card can
__label__computers can access the collection by the numbers million items books photographs maps etc million books new items added each day miles
__label__computers miles of shelves million digital documents terabytes of text data central intelligence agency the central intelligence agency cia is in the
__label__computers the business of collecting and distributing information on people places and things so it should come as no surprise that they
__label__computers they end up on this list although little is known about the overall size of the cia s database it is
__label__computers is certain that the agency has amassed a great deal of information on both the public and private sectors via field
__label__computers field work and digital intrusions portions of the cia database available to the public include the freedom of information act foia
__label__computers foia electronic reading room the world fact book and various other intelligence related publications the foia library includes hundreds of thousands
__label__computers thousands of official and occasionally ultra sensitive u s government documents made available to the public electronically the library grows at
__label__computers at a rate of articles per and contains topics ranging from nuclear development in pakistan to the type of beer available
__label__computers available during the korean war the world fact book boasts general information on every country and territory in the world including
__label__computers including maps population numbers military capabilities and more by the numbers foia items added each comprehensive statistics on more than countries
__label__computers countries and entities unknown number of classified information amazon amazon the world s biggest retail store maintains extensive records on its
__label__computers its million active customers including general personal information phone number address etc receipts wishlists and virtually any sort of data the
__label__computers the website can extract from its users while they are logged on amazon also keeps more than full text books available
__label__computers available online and allows users to comment and interact on virtually every page of the website making amazon one of the
__label__computers the world s largest online communities this data coupled with millions of items in inventory amazon sells each year and the
__label__computers the millions of items in inventory amazon associates sell makes for one very large database amazon s two largest databases combine
__label__computers combine for more than terabytes of data and that s only the beginning of things if amazon published the total number
__label__computers number of databases they maintain and volume of data each database contained the amount of data we know amazon houses would
__label__computers would increase substantially but still you say terabytes that doesn t sound like so much in relative terms terabytes of data
__label__computers data would convert to trillion forum posts by the numbers million active customers more than terabytes of data youtube after less
__label__computers less than two years of operation youtube has amassed the largest video library and subsequently one of the largest databases in
__label__computers in the world youtube currently boasts a user base that watches more than million clips per day accounting for more than
__label__computers than of all videos watched online in august of the wall street journal projected youtube s database to the sound of
__label__computers of terabytes of videos while that figure doesn t sound terribly high relative to the amount of data available on the
__label__computers the internet youtube has been experiencing a period of substantial growth more than new videos per day since that figures publication
__label__computers publication meaning that youtube s database size has potentially more than doubled in the last s estimating the size of youtube
__label__computers youtube s database is particularly difficult due to the varying sizes and lengths of each video however if one were truly
__label__computers truly ambitious and a bit forgiving we could project that the youtube database will expect to grow as much as terabytes
__label__computers terabytes of data in the next given videos per day x days per videos per terabyte megabytes if we assume that
__label__computers that each video has a size of mb youtube would expect to grow terabytes next similarly if we assume that each
__label__computers each video has a size of mb youtube would expect to grow terabytes next by the numbers million videos watched per
__label__computers per day videos added each day of all videos watched online at least terabytes of videos choicepoint imagine having to search
__label__computers search through a phone book containing a billion pages for a phone number when the employees at choicepoint want to know
__label__computers know something about you they have to do just that if printed out the choicepoint database would extend to the moon
__label__computers moon and back times choicepoint is in the business of acquiring information about the american population addresses and phone numbers driving
__label__computers driving records criminal histories etc choicepoint has it all for the most part the data found in choicepoint s database is
__label__computers is sold to the highest bidders including the american government but how much does choicepoint really know in choicepoint was able
__label__computers able to help authorities solve a serial rapist case in philadelphia and fort collins after producing a list of potential suspects
__label__computers suspects by data mining their dna and personal records databases in choicepoint was able to identify the remains of world trade
__label__computers trade center victims by matching dna found in bone fragments to the information provided by victim s family members in conjunction

__label__computers tb of photos we re growing at tb per day i seriously doubt we re on the top list either which
__label__computers which means lots of these entries don t belong let s not forget for example that the internet archive came up
__label__computers up with a platform for their storage called the petabox http www archive org web petabox php but they re not
__label__computers not on the list posted by don macaskill feb pm obtained pricing for a media storage array today tb from ye

__label__computers really interesting is to know the underlying technology that runs these massive databases i doubt it s mysql but that would
__label__computers would be freakin cool now that i ponder that thought i wonder what s the largest mysql database currently out there
__label__computers there posted by greg feb pm what about internet posted by digthisup feb pm this is crap fermilab has petabytes alone
__label__computers alone of collected events and monte carlo events in it s enstore database now if we start including the fact that
__label__computers that cern will be part of this you re way larger then any of this if you re going to make
__label__computers make a top list you should actually go out and search for the top what a bunch of crap posted by

__label__computers that s for sure i must say i am surprised that noaa isn t there posted by bob robertson feb pm
__label__computers pm i think you re taking it a little too serious to clammer and hoo haw about how this isn t
__label__computers t exhaustive pretty much the only ones without any d stats were the top two anyway this was a really interesting
__label__computers interesting on what the hugest amounts of data in the world are storing it makes you wonder how well does the
__label__computers the combined storage of everyone s personal computers stack up compared to databases posted by david feb pm at the small
__label__computers small art studio where i work we ve got about terabytes of storage on external harddrives and dvd s this is
__label__computers is a business with artist and employees i can only imagine the hundreds of corporate businesses that have more than the

__label__computers entire world then we can start over shall i tack him up now posted by lasthorseman feb pm i find it
__label__computers it unlikely that youtube includes their flash videos as binary large objects blobs in the database more likely they keep some
__label__computers some pointer information that tells the application where to find the video files that would shrink the size of their database

__label__computers the top databases and they are growing everyday and i know even years ago they were over tb posted by james
__label__computers james dickens feb pm you guys seem to miss the point that the definition of a database is a database is
__label__computers is a collection of data that is organized so that its contents can easily be accessed managed and updated and although
__label__computers although the term originated from the electronic storage of information in this way the word has been adapted to a generic
__label__computers generic definition of a collection of data that is organized and easily retrievable so that is why anything can be included
__label__computers included i do have to admit however that alot of these dont belong on the top list posted by eric feb

__label__computers say your page is fucking disgusting i hardly can read it cuz the gray and black not exactly the best color
__label__computers color composition secondly who gives a shit who has bigger database or bigger penis we rather need to kill the fucking
__label__computers fucking rats of the world like chinese japanese nigros to avoid the overpopulation we need to massacre their womans all of

__label__computers my access database is over pb at the moment trillion records in the one table alone posted by winky feb pm
__label__computers pm i m suprised that myspace got a mension when hotmail didn t hotmail has been around for atleast years and
__label__computers and probably had more people sign up for it than myspace and you tube put together there probably the number one
__label__computers one target for spam as well i m not suprised that wiki wasn t on there after all it s a

__label__computers that are much bigger than these like the un s for example i am wondering where nasa s db s rank
__label__computers rank thanks posted by andreas maratheftis feb am what about databases in other parts of the world than the us at

__label__computers most impressed with the library of congress to be considered for this list with over million physical items that you can
__label__computers can touch and see is unbelievable the average person has no concept of terabytes or petabytes or whatever posted by urscumm
__label__computers urscumm feb am hold on just a sec terabytes is less than petabyte which is defined as terabytes you ve gotta
__label__computers gotta rearrange these databases mark i guess he meant to say that it was petabytes and they keep tb for quick
__label__computers quick access posted by rolandog feb am while it s fun that you ve tried to put these databases in order
__label__computers order it seems rather arbitrary to put the library of a place dedicated to assembling all books published in a relevant
__label__computers relevant manner to a database that collects a seemingly endless stream of raw data on weather reports world wide it s
__label__computers s the difference of putting someone with a lot knowledge next to someone with a lot of wisdom it s not
__label__computers not a just comparison sure one might have more terabytes know more facts but that doesn t mean it has any
__label__computers any right to be higher up on any list i d be more curious to see a list of the largest
__label__computers largest collections of human knowledge lexus nexus library of etc or any other list determined by far less arbitrary measures then
__label__computers then raw size and if you re determined to do raw size i d do a bit more research first all
__label__computers all the same a fun read for some items thanks for taking the time posted by generic user feb am i
__label__computers i m surprised cern weren t at least considered granted they might not have much in the way of records rows
__label__computers rows compared with say google but they sheer size of the data has got to be in the s of tb
__label__computers tb posted by peter feb am although it d be unreasonable to assume that every db in the world can be
__label__computers be equally measured i found one site company that does a good comparison every couple of years it s voluntary though
__label__computers though so google likely won t be in such a list wintercorp has also their test method on their site that

__label__computers user accounts and mails for each account also the telephone based companies also have lots data because each call data record
__label__computers record is a record that includes you turn on and off the cellphone so the company such as chinese mobile should

__label__computers etc providing explicit information that has a readable form and can be used to solve diagnosis classification or forecasting problems traditionally
__label__computers traditionally these problems were solved by direct hands on data analysis using standard statistical methods but the increasing volume of data
__label__computers data has motivated the study of automatic data analysis using more complex and sophisticated tools which can operate directly from data
__label__computers data thus data mining identifies trends within data that go beyond simple analysis modern data mining techniques association rules decision trees
__label__computers trees gaussian mixture models regression algorithms neural networks support vector machines bayesian networks etc are used in many domains to solve
__label__computers solve association classification segmentation diagnosis and prediction problems among the different data mining algorithms probabilistic graphical models in particular bayesian networks
__label__computers networks is a sound and powerful methodology grounded on probability and statistics which allows building tractable joint probabilistic models that represents
__label__computers represents the relevant dependencies among a set of variables hundreds of variables in real life applications the resulting models allow for
__label__computers for efficient probabilistic inference for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between large scale synoptic fields and local
__label__computers local observation records providing a new methodology for probabilstic downscaling i e allowing to compute p observation large scale prediction for
__label__computers for instance the red dots in the figure below correspond to the grid nodes of a gcm whereas the blue dots
__label__computers dots correspond to a network of stations with historical records the links show the relevant dependencies automatically discovered from data formally
__label__computers formally bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs whose nodes represent variables and whose arcs encode conditional independencies between the variables the
__label__computers the graph provides an intuitive description of the dependency model and defines a simple factorization of the joint probability distribution leading
__label__computers leading to a tractable model which is compatible with the encoded dependencies efficient algorithms exist to learn both the graphical and
__label__computers and the probabilistic models from data thus allowing for the automatic application of this methodogy in complex problems bayesian networks that
__label__computers that model sequences of variables such as for example time series of historical records are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of
__label__computers of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams on the other hand neural
__label__computers neural networks are nonlinear models inspired in the functioning of the brain which have been designed to solve different problems thus
__label__computers thus multi layer perceptrons are regression like algorithms to build a deterministic model y f x relating a set of predictors

__label__computers purposes data mining the analysis step of the knowledge in databases process or kdd an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science is
__label__computers is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence machine learning
__label__computers learning statistics and database systems the overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set
__label__computers set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use aside from the raw analysis step it involves database and
__label__computers and data management aspects data pre processing model and inference considerations interestingness metrics complexity considerations post processing of discovered structures visualization
__label__computers visualization and online updating the term is a buzzword and is frequently misused to mean any form of large scale data
__label__computers data or information processing collection extraction warehousing analysis and statistics but is also generalized to any kind of computer decision support
__label__computers support system including artificial intelligence machine learning and business intelligence in the proper use of the word the key term is
__label__computers is citation needed commonly defined as detecting something new even the popular book data mining practical machine learning tools and techniques
__label__computers techniques with java which covers mostly machine learning material was originally to be named just practical machine learning and the term
__label__computers term data mining was only added for marketing reasons often the more general terms large scale data analysis or analytics or
__label__computers or when referring to actual methods artificial intelligence and machine learning are more appropriate the actual data mining task is the
__label__computers the automatic or semi automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of
__label__computers of data records cluster analysis unusual records anomaly detection and dependencies association rule mining this usually involves using database techniques such
__label__computers such as spatial indices these patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data and may
__label__computers may be used in further analysis or for example in machine learning and predictive analytics for example the data mining step
__label__computers step might identify multiple groups in the data which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a
__label__computers a decision support system neither the data collection data preparation nor result interpretation and reporting are part of the data mining
__label__computers mining step but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional steps the related terms data dredging data fishing and
__label__computers and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that
__label__computers that are or may be too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered
__label__computers discovered these methods can however be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations in the s
__label__computers s statisticians used terms like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing
__label__computers analyzing data without an a priori hypothesis the term data mining appeared around in the database community at the beginning of
__label__computers of the century there was a phrase database mining trademarked by hnc a san diego based company now merged into fico
__label__computers fico to pitch their data mining workstation researchers consequently turned to data mining other terms used include data archaeology information harvesting
__label__computers harvesting information knowledge extraction etc gregory piatetsky shapiro coined the term knowledge in databases for the first workshop on the same
__label__computers same topic and this term became more popular in ai and machine learning community however the term data mining became more

__label__computers with the stages selection pre processing transformation data mining interpretation evaluation it exists however in many variations on this theme such
__label__computers such as the cross industry standard process for data mining crisp dm which defines six phases business understanding data understanding data
__label__computers data preparation modeling evaluation deployment before data mining algorithms can be used a target data set must be assembled as data
__label__computers data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data the target data set must be large enough to contain
__label__computers contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit a common source for data is
__label__computers is a data mart or data warehouse pre processing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining the
__label__computers the target set is then cleaned data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data data mining involves
__label__computers involves six common classes of tasks anomaly detection outlier change deviation detection the identification of unusual data records that might be
__label__computers be interesting or data errors that require further investigation association rule learning dependency modeling searches for relationships between variables for example
__label__computers example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits using association rule learning the supermarket can determine which products are
__label__computers are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes this is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis clustering
__label__computers clustering is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another similar without
__label__computers without using known structures in the data classification is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data for
__label__computers for example an e mail program might attempt to classify an e mail as legitimate or as spam regression attempts to
__label__computers to find a function which models the data with the least error summarization providing a more compact representation of the data
__label__computers data set including visualization and report generation results validation data mining can unintentionally be misused and can then produce results which
__label__computers which appear to be significant but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be reproduced on a new sample
__label__computers sample of data and bear little use often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis
__label__computers hypothesis testing a simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting but the same problem can arise
__label__computers arise at different phases of the process and thus a train test split the final step of knowledge from data is
__label__computers is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set not all patterns
__label__computers patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid it is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns
__label__computers patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set this is called overfitting to overcome this
__label__computers this the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained the learned patterns
__label__computers patterns are applied to this test set and the resulting output is compared to the desired output for example a data
__label__computers data mining algorithm trying to distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on a training set of sample e mails
__label__computers mails once trained the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e mails on which it had not
__label__computers not been trained the accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e mails they correctly classify a
__label__computers a number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm such as roc curves if the learned patterns do
__label__computers do not meet the desired standards subsequently it is necessary to re evaluate and change the pre processing and data mining
__label__computers mining steps if the learned patterns do meet the desired standards then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns

__label__computers producing an output consider this description to develop a feel for this analogy let us consider a few facts from neurobiology
__label__computers neurobiology the human brain is d to contain a densely interconnected network of approximately neurons each connected on average to others

__label__computers am see http enginepuller com matt marshall am re other languages good point powerset said it mindful of this but like
__label__computers like so much of its operations its exact progress here is secretive so we just don t know it s certainly
__label__computers certainly a major challenge nathaniel am it seems like you are putting a huge value on natural search and presuming that
__label__computers that it is the holy grail although there is huge potential it seems presumptuous to assume that users will prefer it
__label__computers it over current solutions and even more presumptuous to assume that the technology from parc is the best of breed in
__label__computers in the space it is especially hard to appreciate the value without seeing anything as pointed out by an earlier poster
__label__computers poster and as mentioned by norvig there are numerous ways to approach natural search indicating that having the parc technology licensed
__label__computers licensed out from under google s nose didn t have them losing sleep at night once the technology is released to
__label__computers to the public and there are meaningful results i will be the first in line to try it out and listen
__label__computers listen to customer reactions but it seems a bit premature to knock a few points off of google s stock price
__label__computers price john ebbert am interesting info and a competitor to google in search is good no doubt i am not convinced
__label__computers convinced until i see the product though thomas hawk am if their technology really works which is a big if of
__label__computers of course remember when riya claimed to do facial recognition now they sell shoes then i d think that yahoo microsoft
__label__computers microsoft or ica should be even more interested in acquiring the company than google rob hyndman am typo gt imb blake
__label__computers blake carrington am google has a huge natural language team as does yahoo but the challenge they have is a user
__label__computers user base trained on using two and three word search strings even if they added awesome nl no one would use
__label__computers use it that said as great as google s results are now i have no doubt that in a few years
__label__computers years people will look back and think about how primitive the page rank idea is matt marshall am thanks on typo
__label__computers typo fixed steve morsa am as promising as their natural language platform sounds and it does the greatest threat to google
__label__computers google s growing hegemony in the search paid search arenas given that about of all searches are known to be for
__label__computers for products and services may actually spring from patent pending paid match which will target people s actual demographic and psychographic
__label__computers psychographic traits and characteristics keytraits instead of just the words we all type into little search boxes though like powerset s
__label__computers s paid match is not yet an operating system our own us dept of labor does run a very popular service
__label__computers service over users which provides an enlightening and instructive peak at the potential that such a paid match search ad platform
__label__computers platform possesses called govbenefits available at govbenefits gov it utilizes a personal profile and a match engine to determine what government
__label__computers government benefit programs people qualify for were such a system populated with the s of thousands to millions of products and
__label__computers and services companies provide nation worldwide instead of just the odd government programs it includes now one can only imagine what
__label__computers what its public popularity would be and with the world s advertisers having the ability to pinpoint target and control via
__label__computers via bidding directly on those keytraits most relevant and applicable to their products and services exactly who sees their ads goodbye
__label__computers goodbye click fraud one can also only imagine the deleterious effects that such an elegant and superior system platform would have
__label__computers have on a ppc income dependent company like google ronald am who acquired ibm i didn t know ibm was acquired
__label__computers acquired or what s the difference between my company acquiring a computer from ibm and and somebody else acquiring a business
__label__computers business unit now if i make up an article about my company acquiring ibm will this article turn up as a
__label__computers a result page ranking would maybe list it as the m link since nobody will believe it and link to it
__label__computers it in other words nlp without shared context is just random sentences used in a conversation or you have a lot
__label__computers lot of explaining to do about what you mean and what you trust or for a right wing nut liberal has
__label__computers has a totally different meaning then for a left wing nut so while page rank includes some of the wisdom of
__label__computers of the crowd how does nlp do that language is very subjective in other words your client system has share your
__label__computers your context with the server if you want to stay sane and get some things done but we are are a
__label__computers a few years away from pretty pictures in the ui to context driven machines but less then years if somebody would
__label__computers would ask me nobody does by the way don t know why sean wilson am interesting article nl will be a
__label__computers a useful tool but as the amount of data available on the web grows faster over time i think it will
__label__computers will be even more useful in limited contexts instead of for broad based search engine applicatons personally i d like to
__label__computers to see a market for elite managed directories that those listed pay to participate in with an account manager handling a
__label__computers a couple hundred sites all of which are highly relevant and vetted for a particular niche a hundred such niches in
__label__computers in a directory that a business or journalist could subscribe to and get quality content answers and results that would serve
__label__computers serve not only as quality research but even immediately actionable intelligence would be kind of cool combine that with yahoo pipes
__label__computers pipes and you could make for a powerful model the problem isn t with search technology so much as it is
__label__computers is with content quality while it might sound a bit retro i wouldn t mind seeing a return of edited directories
__label__computers directories combined with the new nl technology i d pay a subscription fee for vetted results and depend on piped data
__label__computers data that met very specific requirements for outside information and news from xml feeds some day when google bombs are gone
__label__computers gone i might buy into the notion that search is anything to lose sleep over word of mouth and social networking
__label__computers networking are still more intriguing than search to me perhaps because i still put more creedence in wom than any other
__label__computers other marketing tool pipes might help change the status quo for mining data effectively from rss feeds so might this nl
__label__computers nl effort by powerset do the same for search i won t hold my breath hoping anyway great post tbee pm
__label__computers pm don t autonomy the british software company have natural language search they claim to have meaning based computing consumers largely
__label__computers largely see it through blinkx which licenses their tech otherwise it s mainly a business thing but still aren t there
__label__computers there going to be some patent infringement issues here tim pm search engine technology it says may help propel it past
__label__computers past google propel it past google in what way in that they deliver better results in that they ll have more
__label__computers more users in that they ll make more money i could say that msn has better search relevancy than google but
__label__computers but does that mean everyone s going to switch tomorrow google is a powerhouse because of their advertising their search relevancy
__label__computers relevancy is just good enough what sort of money printing machine is powerset building there s no mention of it ronald
__label__computers ronald s point about shared context is extremely relevant i would say google s answer to this is personalized search it
__label__computers it s just in its infancy but it s a start i would say at least or probably more important in
__label__computers in maintaining users is establishing that relationship how long will it take to establish a relationship with powerset so it understands
__label__computers understands what the heck you re asking it what s in it for users to give it that chance michael belanger
__label__computers belanger am powerset is a late comer and far behind others in the nlp search tech space nlp has always thrown
__label__computers thrown away context to fit sql database calls a fundamentally new database architecture is required patents filed as early as to
__label__computers to use every scrap of context expressed by well articulated needs query you can experience an award winning nlp enterprise search

__label__computers verticals john pm don t confuse natural lauguage and linguistics they are quite different mihran shahinian pm they also assume that
__label__computers that users are going to type in full nlq sentences from the experience most end users put keywords inside the search
__label__computers search box kind and thoughtful am this is a great country ideas can come from anywhere they may be instantaneous or
__label__computers or take years to develop then with the persistence and financing they are brought to the world bob new pm my
__label__computers my all time favorite search story is about when i was researching a programming problem i had typed in a line
__label__computers line of compiler generated assembly language that had generated an error the first page returned by the search contained the answer
__label__computers answer i was looking for of course being taken to the exact page was the result of entering a very specific
__label__computers specific query i had entered a fairly long list of query terms each of which have pretty low frequency in the
__label__computers the total web content and of course i was lucky that that page did in fact exist to me the value
__label__computers value in search is finding the one single page that has the exact detail you are looking for in my example
__label__computers example above this occurred because of the number of explicit search terms i had entered but most often i have to
__label__computers to manually search through many pages until either i find what i am looking for eventually search capabilities will improve to
__label__computers to give users more targeted search results by targeted i mean a better threshold for what is relevant to the query
__label__computers query than just this page contains the words you asked for eventually the search threshold will be this page contains the
__label__computers the meaning you asked for in time linguistics will be applied to help improve search capabilities things like word sense disambiguation
__label__computers disambiguation word synonyms and sentence structure will likely all play in this caribbean guy am there are three major problems with
__label__computers with this approach first it is technically difficult to do it well second it isn t necessarily going to be more
__label__computers more appealing to users because they need to use more keystrokes third it tends to create a higher expectation level for
__label__computers for users so users will tend to be more critical of the results any failure to correctly interpret and answer their
__label__computers their question tends to be very noticeable in contrast the simplistic keyword approach less typing it is easier for the search
__label__computers search engine to accomplish and because of the crude manner in which the words are typed into the box users tend
__label__computers tend to dismiss failures as an indication that they failed to type the right keywords vivek juneja am hi i believe
__label__computers believe in what the above person says that has been the major bottleneck when developing any nlu engine i myself had
__label__computers had developed a nl interface to operating system sometime back it worked correctly till users started expecting more and the minor

__label__computers natural language processing blog my biased thoughts on the fields of natural language processing nlp computational linguistics cl and related topics
__label__computers topics machine learning math funding etc february language and x i feel it is increasingly interesting to look at problems that
__label__computers that have both a linguistic and a non linguistic signal the simplest example i can think of here is recent work
__label__computers work in looking at images and their captions eg the matching words and pictures approach though this is not the only
__label__computers only such example the idea in many of these techniques is that we have a single data set that contains two
__label__computers two types of data one is language eg the captions and the other is something else eg the images there are
__label__computers are many other potentially interesting sources of data like this that i ll discuss after saying why i think these problems
__label__computers problems are interesting i think there are two basic reasons why such dual problems are interesting by looking at multiple modalities
__label__computers modalities we can get cross modality reinforcement of what we re learning i think a great example of that is this
__label__computers this paper which uses face recognition together with textual coreference in order to do unsupervised coref in captions the idea is
__label__computers is that if you can tell that two different pictures contain the entity we call bill clinton in them then it
__label__computers it s more likely that a name in their caption will corefer this gives us a greater ability to share data
__label__computers data across a single data set when language is treated in the context of some other source of information we get
__label__computers get a sort of grounding effect that is continuing the coref example from we have in some sense grounded the string
__label__computers string bill clinton to a pictorial representation of a person sure this representation is still just a bunch of symbols but
__label__computers but they re markedly different symbols from the ones we use to represent the entity in purely linguistic terms perhaps hard
__label__computers hard core cognitive scientists wouldn t call this grounding but it s getting there also along these lines one of my
__label__computers my favorite papers from a few years ago was my ex isi friend mike doing grounding by looking and language and
__label__computers and action in video games there are probably other reasons why such tasks are interesting but these are the two that
__label__computers that appeal to me most strongly it seems that vision language is the hot topic or at least the warmest of
__label__computers of the bunch this is probably because vision people and language people tend to overlap and meet at machine learning conferences
__label__computers conferences it s probably also because the sorts of techniques used by the two communities are perhaps the most similar but
__label__computers but i think there s lots of room for looking at other x s for instance biology there are lots of
__label__computers of data sets eg geo that contain textual information these are cell lines depicting ovarian cancer plus the actual cell lines
__label__computers lines heck many papers in pubmed contain such information albeit in figures rather than matrices robotics is another option ray mooney
__label__computers mooney s group down in texas has worked at understanding orders given to robocup competitors based on language information eg this
__label__computers this paper perhaps the oldest that actually lives within the nlp community is nlp databases which we really haven t seen
__label__computers seen much of in the past years i don t think we understand structured prediction i ve posted on structured prediction
__label__computers prediction a few times before and then some this is another post but with a different perspective besides the most recent
__label__computers recent time was last may so it s been a while this post is prompted by a recent oped by john
__label__computers john lafferty and larry wasserman on challenges in machine learning in statistica sinica where they mention sp as one of three
__label__computers three major open questions in machine learning the other two are semi sup and sparse learning in high dimensions i ve
__label__computers ve been trying to think of a good way of ontologizing sp methods recently primarily because i want to understand them
__label__computers them better the more i think about it the more i feel like we really don t understand the important issues
__label__computers issues this is partially evidenced by an observation that in the past six years essentially since the first crf paper there
__label__computers there have been like different algorithms proposed for this problem the fact that there are so many proposed algorithms tells me
__label__computers me that we don t really understand what s going on otherwise we wouldn t need to keep coming up with
__label__computers with new techniques i m not innocent to me the strongest division between techniques is between techniques that require tractable inference
__label__computers inference in the underlying problem eg crfs m ns svm struct structured perceptron mira memms hmms etc and those that don
__label__computers don t eg incremental perceptron laso searn the liang lacoste julien klein taskar mt algorithm local predictors ala roth and colleagues
__label__computers colleagues etc whether this truly is the most important distinction is unclear but to me it is i think of the
__label__computers the former set as a sort of top down or technology push techniques while the latter are a sort of bottom
__label__computers bottom up or application pull techniques both are entirely reasonable and good ways of going at looking at the problem but
__label__computers but as of now the connections between the two types are only weakly understood an alternative division is between generative techniques
__label__computers techniques hmms conditional methods crfs and margin based techniques everything else minus searn which is sort of non committal with respect
__label__computers respect to this issue i don t really think this is an important distinction because with the exception of generative being
__label__computers being quite different conditional methods and margin based methods are essentially the same in my mind yes i understand there are
__label__computers are important differences but it seems that in the grand scheme of things this is not such a relevant distinctions a
__label__computers a related issue is whether the algorithms admit a kernelized version pretty much all do and even if not i also
__label__computers also don t see this as a very important issue there are other issues some of which are mentioned in the
__label__computers the lafferty wasserman paper one is consistency for those unfamiliar with the term a consistent algorithm is essentially one that is
__label__computers is guaranteed to find the optimal solution if given infinite amounts of data crfs are consistent m ns are not searn
__label__computers searn is not even if you use a consistent classifier as the base learning algorithm my sense is that to statisticians
__label__computers statisticians things like consistency matter a lot in practice my opinion is that they re less important because we never have
__label__computers have that much data even within the context of techniques that don t require tractability there is a great deal of
__label__computers of variation to my knowledge this family of techniques was essentially spawned by collins and roark with the incremental perceptron my
__label__computers my laso thing was basically just a minor tweak on the ip searn is rather different but other published methods are
__label__computers are largely other minor variants on the ip and or laso depending on where you measure from and i truly mean
__label__computers mean minor tweaks the essentially difference between laso and ip is whether you restart your search at the truth when you
__label__computers you err doing restarts tends to help and it lets you prove a theorem we later had a nips workshop paper
__label__computers paper that restarted but allowed the algorithm to take a few steps off the right path before doing so this helped
__label__computers helped experimentally and also admitted another theorem i ve seen other work that does essentially the same thing but tweaks how
__label__computers how updates are done exactly and or how restarts happen the fact that we re essentially trying all permutations tells me
__label__computers me that many things are reasonable and we re currently in the gather data part of trying to figure out the
__label__computers the best way to do things bag of words citation i was recently asked by a colleague if i knew what
__label__computers what the first paper was that used the bag of words model i m pretty certain it would be an ir
__label__computers ir paper but have no idea what i would be manning schutze and jurafsky martin don t have it i know
__label__computers know tf idf is due to sparck jones but i presumably bow existed before that the vector space model is often
__label__computers often credited to salton which is probably the earliest thing i know of but my guess is that bow predated even
__label__computers even that errors happen and sometimes get in to papers a recent example is the jair paper i had with daniel
__label__computers daniel on domain adaptation last year i actually didn t catch the error myself it was caught by someone who was
__label__computers was reimplementing the technique and it s a totally not insignificant error essentially the update equation for the generative parameters is
__label__computers is completely botched if you look through the derivation in the appendix it s clear where the error crept in thankfully
__label__computers thankfully this sort of error is essentially a typo that is the error was introduced when i was typing up the
__label__computers the paper not when i was doing the research why this is important is that it means the the implementation reflects
__label__computers reflects the correct updates only the paper has the mistake this means that the experimental results from the paper are valid
__label__computers valid contingent on the fact that you rederive the updates yourself or just ask me what they should be i m
__label__computers m writing this post because it s somewhat unclear what to do when such a thing arises one temptation is to
__label__computers to do nothing i have to admit that i was completely embarrassed when this was pointed out to me there was
__label__computers was a part of me that wanted to ignore it it seems that this is the wrong approach for a variety
__label__computers variety of reasons not the least of which is to make sure that correct information does get out the question to
__label__computers to some degree is exactly how to do this i have a blog which means i can write an entry like
__label__computers like this i can also put an errata on my web page that points out the errors i m writing this
__label__computers this up as we speak given that this is a pub in an online journal i believe i am able to
__label__computers to submit updates or at least additional appendices which means that the official version can probably be remedied but what about
__label__computers about conference pubs if this had appeared in acl and i didn t have a blog the situation would be something
__label__computers something different ironically an earlier version with the correct updates had been rejected from acl because the derivations were omitted for
__label__computers for space and two reviewers couldn t verify them also what if someone hadn t pointed it out to me i
__label__computers i certainly wouldn t have noticed that paper was behind me but then anyone who noticed the errors might dismiss the
__label__computers the results on the grounds that they could assume that the implementation was also incorrect it s not inconceivable that an
__label__computers an erroneous implementation can still get good results this would also not be good because the idea in the paper any
__label__computers any paper with such errors might actually be interesting false things are published all the time the stoc focs community i
__label__computers i e theory community has a handful of examples for them errors are easy to identify because you can prove the
__label__computers the opposite of any theorem i recall hearing of a sequence of several papers that incrementally used results from a previous
__label__computers previous but the first was in error putting the rest in error i also recall hearing that many of the subsequent
__label__computers subsequent results could be salvaged despite the ancestral mistake i don t know if there s a good solution given our
__label__computers our publication mechanisms essentially publish once then appear in the anthology but i m pretty sure mine is not the first
__label__computers first paper with such errors at least i hope not acl again this year in the machine learning subcomponent a couple
__label__computers couple of days ago i received my notice to start bidding on papers more on bidding below the email came with
__label__computers with the ing note naturally reviewers have been chosen to assess papers based on their own expertise and outlook having said
__label__computers said this we are aware that acl has sometimes been perceived especially in recent years as overemphasizing the pursuit of small
__label__computers small incremental improvements of existing methods perhaps at the expense of exciting new developments acl is solid but boring is what
__label__computers what some people would say while we believe that it would be counterproductive to change course radically we certainly would not
__label__computers not want to sacrifice solidity we would like to encourage you as a reviewer to look out particularly for what s
__label__computers s novel and interesting even if this means accepting a paper that has one or two flaws for example because it
__label__computers it has not been evaluated as rigourously as you would like it is for you to judge when a flaw becomes
__label__computers becomes a genuine problem i think this is fantastic would someone who is reviewing i e on the pc for another
__label__computers another area confirm or deny that all areas got such a message or was it just ml one difficulty i always
__label__computers always have as a reviewer is that i assign scores to different categories originality interest citations etc and then am asked
__label__computers asked to come up with a meta score that summarizes all these scores but i m not given any instruction on
__label__computers on how to weigh the different components what this note seems to be doing is saying weigh interest higher than you
__label__computers you usually would in the past two years or so i ve been trying to do this i think that when
__label__computers when you start out reviewing it s tempting to pick apart little details on a paper rather than focusing on the
__label__computers the big picture it s been a conscious and sometimes difficult process for me to get over this this explicit note
__label__computers note is nice to see because it is essentially saying that my own internal process is a good one or at
__label__computers at least whomever wrote it thinks it s a good one i also think in comparison to other conferences i ve
__label__computers ve pced for or reviewed for that acl does a really good job of moderating the bidding process for those unfamiliar
__label__computers unfamiliar with bidding when a paper gets submitted some area chair picks it up all papers under an area chair are
__label__computers are shown title plus abstract to the reviewers in that area reviewers can bid i want to review this i don
__label__computers don t want to review this i am qualified to review this or conflict of interest there is then some optimization
__label__computers optimization strategy to satisfy reviewers preferences constraints in comparison to ecml and nips in the past the acl strategy of dividing
__label__computers dividing into area chairs seems to be a good thing for ecml i got a list of about papers to select
__label__computers select from and i had to rank them or i don t remember this was a huge hassle it seems that
__label__computers that of most of the conferences that i m familiar with acl has a pretty decent policy while i would be
__label__computers be thrilled to see them introduce an author feedback step everything else seems to work pretty well in the past i
__label__computers i ve only once gotten in to a real argument over a paper with other reviewers most of the time all
__label__computers all the reviewer scores have tended to be or out of ten of each other error analysis to be performed and
__label__computers and reported in papers while this is perhaps a bit extreme more on this later there are at least two reasons
__label__computers reasons why this would be desirable when multiple techniques exist for solving the same problem and they get reasonably close scores
__label__computers scores is this because they are making the same sort of errors or different sorts if someone were to build on
__label__computers on your paper and try to improve it where should they look there s an additional aspect that comes up especially
__label__computers especially once you re in a sort of supervisory role it s often hard to get students to actually look at
__label__computers at outputs and forcing this as part of the game early on is a good idea i was the same as
__label__computers as a student and continue to be the same now only two or three our of a dozen or so papers
__label__computers papers of mine contain an error analysis this situation reminds me a bit of an excellent talk i saw a few
__label__computers few years ago at acl or emnlp in barcelona i think by mitch marcus talking about some parsing stuff i don
__label__computers don t really remember much of his talk except that he kept flashing a single slide that read look at the
__label__computers the data stupid his argument was essentially that we re not going to be able to model what we want to
__label__computers to model unless we really understand what s going on in the data representing the phenomena we re trying to study
__label__computers study an exercise that s also good from this perspective is to do some data annotation yourself this is perhaps even
__label__computers even more painful than doing an error analysis but it really drives home the difficulties in the task getting back to
__label__computers to the point at hand i don t think it s feasible or even necessarily advisable to require all papers to
__label__computers to include an error analysis but i also think that more papers should contain error analyses than actually do including some
__label__computers some of my own in the universal struggle to fit papers within an page limit things have to get cut it
__label__computers it seems that the error analysis is the first thing to get cut in that it gets cut before the paper
__label__computers paper is even typically by not being performed but at least for me when i read a paper i want to
__label__computers to know after the fact what i have learned occasionally it s a new learning technique or occasionally it s some
__label__computers some new useful features or sometimes it s a new problem but if you were to take the most popular problems
__label__computers problems out there that i don t work on mt parsing language modeling asr etc i really have no idea what
__label__computers what problems are still out there i can guess i think names in mt are hard as is ordering i think
__label__computers think probably attachment and conjunctions in parsing i have little idea in lm and asr computational linguistics from parc i hope
__label__computers hope that everyone can access this freely but i sadly suspect it is not so i m half tempted to reproduce
__label__computers reproduce it since i think it s really worth reading but i don t want to piss off the gods at
__label__computers at mit press too much the main point i got from the article is that we really need to pay attention
__label__computers attention to how annotation is done a lot of our exuberance for annotating is due to the success of machine learning
__label__computers learning approaches on the treebank so we have since gone out and annotated probably hundreds of corpora for dozens of other
__label__computers other tasks the article focuses on coreference but i think most of the claims apply broadly the first point made is
__label__computers is that the treebank annotation was controlled and done by experts linguists many other annotates are not done so are done
__label__computers done without real standards and without deep analysis of the task the immediate problem then is that a learning algorithm that
__label__computers that succeeds on the annotated data is not necessarily solving the right task there was a similar story that my ex
__label__computers ex office mate alex fraser ran across in machine translation specifically with evaluating alignments for machine translation the basic problem was
__label__computers was two fold first the dataset that everyone used the french english data from aachen was essentially broken due largely to
__label__computers to its distinction between sure and possible links almost every word pair was possibly linked this together with the broken evaluation
__label__computers evaluation metric alignment error rate or aer made results on this dataset virtually useless the conclusion is essentially don t use
__label__computers use the aachen data and don t use aer that is don t use them if you want improved mt performance
__label__computers performance i e if you expect higher alignment performance to imply higher mt performance if this sounds familiar it s perhaps
__label__computers perhaps because i mentioned it before i should say i largely agree with the article where i differ perhaps only by
__label__computers by epsilon is that the article seems to pick on annotation for machine learning but i really don t see any
__label__computers any reason why the fact that we re using machine learning matters the issue is really one of evaluation we need
__label__computers need to know that at the end of the day when we compute a number that number matters we can compute
__label__computers compute a number intrinsically or extrinsically in the extrinsic case we are golden assuming the extrinsic task is real turtles upon
__label__computers upon turtles in the intrinsic case the situation is fishy we have to make sure that both our annotations mean something
__label__computers something and our method of computing error rate means something ala the error metric types and the use of f for
__label__computers for named entities while i ve argued on this blog that the error metric is important the cl article argues that
__label__computers that the annotation is important i think that as someone who is on the machine learning side this is easy to
__label__computers to forget survey of parser usage i know people use parsers a fair amount i m curious which parsers people use
__label__computers use thus a new poll what i m interested in in particular is if you use a parser essentially as a
__label__computers a preprocessing step before doing something higher level in other words if you are mark johnson and you use the charniak
__label__computers charniak parser to build a better parser this doesn t count sorry mark i want to know if you use one
__label__computers one to do eg summarization or mt or ie or something other than parser also i don t count shallow parsing
__label__computers parsing in this context i look forward to responses do you use a parser for your work nope no parsing in
__label__computers in this neck of the woods yes one of the brown parsers charniak johnson etc yes one of the collins parsers
__label__computers parsers collins bikel etc yes minipar yes one of the conll dependency parsers nivre mcdonald etc yes a rule based parser
__label__computers parser this database was pretty huge many thousands of problems neatly categorized and searchable for emails for which the answer existed
__label__computers existed in the database it took maybe seconds to send the reply out what seems to be happening nowadays is that
__label__computers that this is being taken to the extreme a pre form letter is always used regardless of whether it is appropriate
__label__computers appropriate or not if it is a person doing this bad routing that s a waste of seconds of person time
__label__computers time probably more for these large companies if it s a machine it s no big deal from there perspective but
__label__computers but it makes me immediately hate the company with my whole heart but this seems to be a really interesting text
__label__computers text categorization routing problem basically you have lots of normal classes the pre letters plus a needs human attention class there
__label__computers there s a natural precision recall trade off which is somewhat different and more complex than is standardly considered but it
__label__computers it s clearly an nlp text categorization problem and clearly one that should be worked on i know from my friends
__label__computers friends at at t that they have something similar for routing calls but my understanding is that this is quite different
__label__computers different their routing happens based on short bits of information into a small number of categories the customer service routing problem
__label__computers problem would presumably be based on lots of information in a large number of categories you could argue that this is
__label__computers is no different from providing a help search option on the ebay web page but i think it s different if
__label__computers if for no other reason that how it appears to the user if the user thinks he is writing an email
__label__computers email to a person he will write a good email with full sentences and lots of information naacl accepted papers see
__label__computers see here i probably won t be going to naacl so if afterwards someone wants to volunteer to post a few
__label__computers few papers they especially liked i d appreciate it learning when test and train inputs have different distributions nips workshop i
__label__computers i spent the second day of workshops at nips while not skiing attending the learning when test and train inputs have
__label__computers have different distributions workshop this is closely related or really just a different name for the domain adaptation problem i ve
__label__computers ve been interested in for quite some time unfortunately i can t easily come across the list of papers there were
__label__computers were some good ones which means that my memory may be lacking at some parts here are some points i took
__label__computers took away statisticians have worked on this problem for a long time if you provide insurance you re going to want
__label__computers want a predictor to say whether to give a new person a policy or not you have lots of data on
__label__computers on people and whether they made any claims unfortunately the training data people you have information on is limited to those
__label__computers those to whom you gave policies so the test distribution entire popular differs from the training distribution people to whom you
__label__computers you gave policies some guy can t remember his name right now actually won a nobel prize in economics for a
__label__computers a partial solution to this problem which was termed covariate shift because statisticians call our inputs covariates and they are changing
__label__computers changing there seems to be a strong desire to specify models which though see the comment below can be characterized as
__label__computers as train p y x and test p y x are the same but train p x and test p x
__label__computers x differ in other words the labeling function is the same but the distribution over inputs is different this is probably
__label__computers probably the clearest way to differentiate domain adaptation from multitask learning for the latter we typically assume p x stays the
__label__computers the same but p y x changes i m not sure that this is really a hugely important distinction it may
__label__computers may be to obtain interesting theoretical results but my sense is that in the problems i encounter both p x and
__label__computers and p y x are changing but hopefully not by too much an interesting point made along these lines by shai
__label__computers shai ben david that i spent a bunch of time thinking about several years ago was that from a theoretical perspective
__label__computers perspective assuming p y x is the same is a vacuous assumption because you can always take two radically different p
__label__computers p x and q x add a feature that indicates which p vs q the data point came from and call
__label__computers call this the global p x in fact in some sense this is all you need to do to solve multitask
__label__computers multitask learning or domain adaptation just add a feature saying which distribution the input is from and learn a single model
__label__computers model i ve been doing some experiments recently and while you can do better than this in practice with standard learning
__label__computers learning models it s not such a bad approach there were several other talks i liked it seemed that the results
__label__computers results theoretically were of the form if p y x is the same and p x and p y differ only
__label__computers only by a little then doing naive things for learning can do nicely my favorite formalization of p x and p
__label__computers p y differ a little was the shai ben david john blitzer approach of saying that they differ slightly if there
__label__computers there is a single hyperplane that does well has low error on both problems the restriction to hyperplanes is convenient for
__label__computers for what they do later but in general it seems that having a single hypothesis from some class that will do
__label__computers do well on both problems is the general sense of what p y x is the same is really supposed to
__label__computers to mean i also enjoyed a talk by alex smola on essentially learning the differences between the input distributions and using
__label__computers using this to your advantage in general my sense was that people are really starting to understand this problem theoretically but
__label__computers but i really didn t see any practical results that convinced me at all most practical results modulo the ben david
__label__computers david blitzer which essentially cites john s old work were very nipsish in the sense that they were on unrealistic datasets
__label__computers datasets sorry but it s true i wholeheartedly acknowledge that its somewhat difficult to get your hands on good data for
__label__computers for this problem but there is data out there and it s plentiful enough that it should no longer be necessary
__label__computers necessary to make artificial or semi artificial data for this problem after all if there weren t real data out there
__label__computers there we wouldn t be working on this problem or at least we shouldn t p back from nips the s
__label__computers s are upon us hence the lack of posts but i wanted to give a brief nod to nips which i
__label__computers i thought went pretty well this year the highlights for me note that i didn t attend everything so the usual
__label__computers usual qualifications apply were the netflex prize talk bennett talked about the origins of the prize and how well people are
__label__computers are doing they seem to firmly believe that the goal will be met there s some indication it actually won t
__label__computers t take all that long currently leading the pack at the time of the talk was wxyz who is one of
__label__computers of my old cmu buddies yi zhang now at ucsc nearly tied for first was geoff hinton s group up at
__label__computers at toronto there weren t any details given about what people are doing to do so well but it seems reasonable
__label__computers reasonable to assume that toronto is doing something with deep belief nets more later free lunches invited talk by dan ariely
__label__computers ariely this was probably my favorite talk of the whole conference the gist of the talk is that it s really
__label__computers really easy to get humans to behave in ways that defy the standard cost benefit analysis setting a few fun examples
__label__computers examples split a bunch of people into two groups have one group write down things they like about their significant other
__label__computers other have the other group write things then ask them how much they love their so the result is that the
__label__computers the things group loves them much more presumably because no one can actually list things there were also a lot of
__label__computers of examples about how often people cheat the basic result is that it seems that knowing you cannot be caught does
__label__computers does not necessarily make you cheat more also if you prime people by having them sign an honor code they cheat
__label__computers cheat less there were many more examples i m not quite positive what the take home message was but it was
__label__computers was a very interesting talk analysis of representations for domain adaptation blitzer et al this is the first compelling analysis i
__label__computers i ve seen of the domain adaptation problem the basic idea is to bound generalization error based on the distance between
__label__computers between the source and target distributions quite clever and john says that they may even try to develop algorithms that explicitly
__label__computers explicitly minimize this bound boosting structured prediction for imitation learning ratliff et al a cute feature boosting algorithm for sp problems
__label__computers problems used for the ing a map problem large margin gaussian mms for asr sha saul do standard gaussian mixture modeling
__label__computers modeling for asr but put a large margin constraint on the gaussians do a hard em like thing to get fixed
__label__computers fixed cluster assignments and you can write this as a semi definite program very cute greedy layer wise training of deep
__label__computers deep networks bengio et al deep belief nets can do a really good job at some vision problems but they re
__label__computers re quite hard to train symmetries etc the basic idea here is to initialize the training by a simple layer at
__label__computers at a time method the thing i found especially interesting is that their initialization looks a lot like a predict yourself
__label__computers yourself sort of strategy which seems to be a recurring theme in a lot of unsupervised semi supervised learning problem there
__label__computers there were also a lot of good workshops i most enjoyed the one on covariate shift i e domain adaptation i
__label__computers i enjoyed it so much i plan to post separately on it in a few days schedule permitting i gave a
__label__computers a talk today at our small group meeting about feature engineering for coreference resolution problems i think it is oft underappreciated
__label__computers underappreciated by people myself occasionally included who spend a lot of time working on fancy machine learning algorithms that the difference
__label__computers difference between success and failure often hinges more on clever features than on fancy learning for those who want to look
__label__computers look at the slides you can take an openoffice or pdf version for your perusal i forewarn that it may be
__label__computers be a bit hard to without the soundtrack but it s sort of an untold story version of the coref paper
__label__computers paper we had at hlt emnlp so what did we do that s clever or at least as far clever as
__label__computers as i knew at the time and know now well a few things first i tried extending the notion of hobbs
__label__computers hobbs distance to discourse trees this actually works surprisingly well the true referent is the first element according to syntactic hobbs
__label__computers hobbs distance in about of the cases and we almost see the same thing at the discourse level the only oddity
__label__computers oddity is that you have to flip the nuclearity of the attribution relation then you get about holding assuming perfect discourse
__label__computers discourse trees of course we never have perfect discourse trees and the noise introduced by poor parsing is enough to make
__label__computers make this feature more or less useless the second thing we tried was to use this name instance data that mike
__label__computers mike fleischman gathered at isi before going off to mit this data was gathered in the context of q a to
__label__computers to answer questions like who is the president of the u s by using lookup tables but it s great data
__label__computers data for coref it includes about million examples of names paired with their occupations maybe you can find this data interesting
__label__computers interesting too mike describes it more in his acl paper these guys make a huge difference in coref performance the next
__label__computers next thing that helped a lot was a clever non standard use of gazetteers what we do is take the id
__label__computers id of the gazetteer to which the anaphor belongs and pair it with the lexical item of the antecedent why well
__label__computers well suppose we have a gazetteer that contains words like california and utah and new york by pairing this list id
__label__computers id eg list with antecedents we get features like list and state or list and country etc we ll probably learn
__label__computers learn that the former is a good feature and the latter is not we also have a feature that checks to
__label__computers to see if the two referents are on the same gazetteer but are not the same word why this is a
__label__computers a negative feature california and utah appear on the same list states but are not identical string wise so they re
__label__computers re probably not coreferent we tried pretty hard to get wordnet to work but it just kept not helping wordnet distance
__label__computers distance is a terrible measure eg japan and russia have distance they are both under country on the other hand like
__label__computers like in the gazetteer case nearby in wordnet but not the same word is a reasonably good feature though it turned
__label__computers turned out not to help much hypernym and hyponym were the most promising but we never actually got any benefit from
__label__computers from them the rest of the stuff in the talk made it fairly close to the front of the paper the
__label__computers the most surprising result was that count based features help a lot these features look at things like the entity to
__label__computers to mention ratio the number of entities detected so far etc these can t be included in a simple coref model
__label__computers model that makes pairwise decisions but for us it s easy the end result is that using just string based features
__label__computers features standard substring and edit distance stuff lexical features word pairs count based features and mike s data we can get
__label__computers get an ace score of using laso for doing the learning this goes up about if you use searn in most
__label__computers most cases but i don t have all the numbers adding in some inference to predict things like number and gender
__label__computers gender gets you up to gazetteers get you up to after that the rest of the features regular expression patterns word
__label__computers word clusters wordnet discourse and syntax don t help all together they get you up to but that s not much
__label__computers much bang for the buck my conclusion is basically that while learning makes a difference searn is a bit better than
__label__computers than laso the feature engineering makes a bigger one many of the features we found useful were a priori not really
__label__computers really that obvious i spent a or two of my life trying to come up with ways of being clever to
__label__computers to help improve performance playing on dev data so as to be fair it s definitely a non trivial enterprise but
__label__computers but it often pays off this is assuming that your learning is robust enough to handle the features you want for
__label__computers for instance the standard pairwise models could not handle the count based features that helped us a lot any stem cell
__label__computers cell research i was listening to npr a few weeks ago while pre election news was still accosting my ears though
__label__computers though not in my state shockingly there was apparently a measure on the ballots in a lot of states referencing stem
__label__computers stem cell research the title of the measure was apparently should any stem cell research be allowed okay quick quiz how
__label__computers how did you first interpret that sentence if you were in favor of certain varieties but not all varieties of stem
__label__computers stem cell research would you vote for it in other words does any mean at least one type of or all
__label__computers all types of to me and at least a few other people i ve talked to the prefered interpretation is all
__label__computers all it s also much easier to reach this interpretation if you put a bit of stress on any but it
__label__computers it s also really easy to get the other interpretation by unstressing any or by putting another sentence in front of
__label__computers of it eg stem cell research in all forms is purely evil p the strange thing is that i m really
__label__computers really having a hard time coming up with other examples where the preference for all is so strong even with the
__label__computers the stress it seems that the fact that stem cell research is a class of things rather than a single thing
__label__computers thing is important it also seems that the presence of should is pretty much necessary but even so i really can
__label__computers can t get anything else to come out with such a strong preference for all so what does this have to
__label__computers to do with nlp well not too much other than language is hard something like this would probably kill a textual
__label__computers textual entailment system but given that it s somewhat ambiguous even to people the degree of ambiguity is person relative though
__label__computers though a brit here tells me that he has a really hard time getting the all interpretation at all maybe there
__label__computers there s just nothing that can be done about it why speech summarization the vast majority of work on summarization is
__label__computers is at the text level a document or collection of documents comes in as text and a summary goes out as
__label__computers as text although i m certainly not one of the ones pushing summarization of speech i think it s quite an
__label__computers an interesting task here by speech summarization i pretty much mean speech in speech out though similar arguments could be made
__label__computers made for text in speech out applications a lot of my conclusion comes from personal experience but i also had a
__label__computers a really great conversation with alan black who works on speech synthesis problems let me motivate this by an personal anecdote
__label__computers anecdote my mom tends to leave really long voicemail messages like really long usually she overruns the alloted time and has
__label__computers has to call back it s not uncommon for her messages to span three mailbox slots sorry mom if you re
__label__computers re reading this the most interesting thing about these messages is that they really don t contain that much information in
__label__computers in fact there s usually only one or two sentences in the whole thing that really matter at least from an
__label__computers an information sense the problem is that you can t skim voicemail if i get an equally long email say one
__label__computers one that would take me minutes to read i can fairly easily skim it to get the gist especially with some
__label__computers some tailored highlighting i m able to absorb much more text per second than speech per second word on the street
__label__computers street or at least around the croissant table at acl is that studies have been done that show that people can
__label__computers can get at information from text just as fast if its presented in a summary as if its not summarized at
__label__computers at all essentially because we re really good at skimming i knew high school english taught me something incidentally if anyone
__label__computers anyone has a reference for this let me know i believe i saw it ages ago but i can t remember
__label__computers remember where and i d love to have it so one solution to the mom s message problem is to run
__label__computers run automatic speech recognition and turn it into an email this has the added advantage that i check my email much
__label__computers much more frequently than i check my voicemail it gives me a record of the message after i ve deleted the
__label__computers the speech signal to save space and allows for indexing but there are also times when i don t have easy
__label__computers easy access to a computer and i really do want listen to the voicemail this is where speech summarization becomes interesting
__label__computers interesting anyway if you re now convinced that speech summarization is interesting well i don t really know what to tell
__label__computers tell you since i really haven t looked at this problem the work i am aware of and this is a
__label__computers a very biased sample i apologize that i missed something is summarizing speech without text using hidden markov models by sameer
__label__computers sameer maskey and julia hirshberg sentence extractive automatic speech summarization and evaluation techniques by makoto hirohata yosuke shinnaka koji iwano and
__label__computers and sadaoki furui furui has been working in this area for a while i can t find this exact paper but
__label__computers but his lab has others evaluation of sentence selection for speech summarization by xiaodan zhu and gerald penn additionally a quick
__label__computers quick search turned up a recent workshop at interspeech on speech summarization which probably has more and information than i can
__label__computers can easily produce myself sequence labeling okay at long last it s time for another edition of getting started in p
__label__computers p s if you want to write one of these for your area of expertise i m very open to it
__label__computers it so what is sequence labeling it s the meta problem that we face all the time in nlp tasks where
__label__computers where we want to assign a single label to each element in a sequence for us a sequence is usually a
__label__computers a sentence and a word is an element the elements we are trying to assign are usually things like parts of
__label__computers of speech syntactic chunk labels is this part of a noun phrase verb phrase etc named entity labels is this a
__label__computers a person and so on information extraction systems i e extracting meeting times and locations from emails can also be treated
__label__computers treated as sequence labeling problems there are roughly two varieties of sequence labeling raw labeling and joint segmentation and labeling the
__label__computers the latter is imo more common raw labeling is something like pos tagging where each element gets a single tag joint
__label__computers joint segmentation and labeling is where whole segments get the same label for instance in named entity recognition a sentence like
__label__computers like yesterday george bush gave a speech contains example one named entity george bush here we want to assign the label
__label__computers label person to the entire phrase george bush not to individual words for instance if two named abut we need to
__label__computers to know where they separate the easiest way to deal with segmentation problems is to transform them into raw labeling problems
__label__computers problems the standard way to do this is the bio encoding where we label each word by b x i x
__label__computers x or o here b x means begin a phrase of type x i x means continue a phrase of type
__label__computers type x and o means not in a phrase for instance the bush sentence would be labeled as yesterday o o
__label__computers o george b per bush i per gave o a o speech o o once can now treat this as a
__label__computers a raw labeling problem perhaps being careful to avoid producing impossible sequences at test time eg an i x can only
__label__computers only a b x or another i x other encodings are also possible so for now i ll concentrate on raw
__label__computers raw labeling and revisit the true joint segmentation problem at the end in raw labeling we re faced with the problem
__label__computers problem of assigning a single label to each word in a sequence perhaps the easiest approach is to predict each label
__label__computers label independently then we just have a collection of multiclass classification tasks each label is a different class we can use
__label__computers use whatever classifier we want for this despite it s simplicity this approach is actually quite effective for many problems intuitively
__label__computers intuitively we usually believe that the labels in these problems are not independent for instance in pos tagging it s basically
__label__computers basically impossible to have a verb immediately ing a determiner we would therefore like to use some local sequence information to
__label__computers to improve our performance the old school approach to doing this is to use a hidden markov model hmm i ll
__label__computers ll refer you to manning schutze for details here keeping in mind that really what we re using is just a
__label__computers a markov model in these problems there is nothing that s hidden but the basic idea here is that we have
__label__computers have two probability distributions a transition distribution how likely is it that a verb will a determiner and an emission distribution
__label__computers distribution how likely is it that we ll see the word the given that we know this word should be a
__label__computers a determiner if our transition probabilities are local then the viterbi algorithm will run efficiently at test time this locality is
__label__computers is referred to as the markov assumption specifically a first order markov assumption says that the probability of label at time
__label__computers time t is independent of label at time t given the label at time t the higher markov order you use
__label__computers use the harder it is to decode complexity wise the potential problem with using hmms is that the emission probabilities are
__label__computers are of the form p word tag where we d really like to model p tag word the latter is preferable
__label__computers preferable because it s easier to include lots of overlapping features capitalization word identity prefixes suffixes stems etc the partial solution
__label__computers solution is to use a maximum entropy markov model memm where we model p tag word using a maximum entropy model
__label__computers model but keep everything else as in an hmm memms are only slightly more complex to train than hmms but work
__label__computers work a whole lot better at training time we essentially include features having to do with the previous labels but otherwise
__label__computers otherwise this is just as in the independent classifiers approach viterbi search still runs at test time so we re limited
__label__computers limited to the same markov order constraints as hmms the potential problem with memms noticing a trend here p is that
__label__computers that when the models are trained they are trained against correct previous labels that is when we create a classification example
__label__computers example corresponding to the label at time t we include features that depend on the label at time t but these
__label__computers these will always be correct at training time but can be wrong at test time this leads to the infamous label
__label__computers label bias problem the conditional random field crf is essentially an answer to this problem instead of training to predict each
__label__computers each label independently but then running viterbi at test time we train to get the whole sequence right this is a
__label__computers a good instance of having identical training and testing situations training crfs is a bit of a bore since each iteration
__label__computers iteration of training requires one to run the forward backward algorithm over each training instance but crfs do often perform better
__label__computers better than plain memms the umass group has been nice enough to release their crf implementation once we get to crfs
__label__computers crfs we can play a bunch of other games for instance we can essentially come up with a margin based version
__label__computers version of the crf this is roughly like moving from maxent to svms the result is either max margin markov networks
__label__computers networks or svmstruct depending on exactly how you formulate the problem the latter has a nice implementation available to play with
__label__computers with so that s a whole lot of learning but where the action really is in the features for me there
__label__computers there s essentially a standard feature set i always use for these problems and then add and subtract as i see
__label__computers see fit the features i usually use are the ing with examples based on the word george the exact word george
__label__computers george the stem george prefixes of length g ge and geo suffixes of length rge ge and e and some regexps
__label__computers regexps the most useful i use is to transform all capital letters to a all lower case to a all numbers
__label__computers numbers to and all punctuation to then we collapse identical adjacent letters so george aaaaaa aa finally i use list of
__label__computers of people places and organizations collected from various gazetteers and check whether each word falls in any of these lists incidentally
__label__computers incidentally these are available as part of my tagchunk program for solving joint tagging chunking problems all of these features are
__label__computers are typically applied in a window of or words around the given word you can see exactly what i calculate in
__label__computers in this perl script the final issue in features is what to do with the transition features in particular one can
__label__computers can think of putting the lexical features on nodes or edges by putting them on nodes i mean that you have
__label__computers have features like previous tag is dt current word is george current case is aa but you can also do a
__label__computers a conjunction thing and say previous tag is dt current word is george and previous tag is dt current case is
__label__computers is aa and previous tag is dt this obviously blows up your feature space but if you have enough data it
__label__computers it s almost always worth doing now getting back to the segmentation issue the fact that there are multiple valid encodings
__label__computers encodings for mapping segmentation raw labeling is probably a bad thing it seems that ideally we d like to learn to
__label__computers to do the segmentation directly this is really not that hard and it comes with a bunch of benefits especially in
__label__computers in what features you can employ for instance you can check if the whole string george bush falls in a list
__label__computers list of names or you can notice that both words are capitalized these are both great phrase based features more evidence
__label__computers evidence has been published that treating these problems as segmentation problems directly is beneficial the acl universe is now a wiki

__label__computers makes a compelling pitch for those who really don t know search or haven t heard the natural language mantra before
__label__computers before i ve seen the pitch time and time again you pick out an example that shows how quot bad quot
__label__computers quot search is on an existing search engine demonstrate how natural language search would work better on your service sit back
__label__computers back and collect the press attention what are the problems with this first most searches are two to three words long
__label__computers long you can t conceptually analyze them because there s simply not enough information to do so they aren t sentences
__label__computers sentences where an ambiguous meaning becomes clear to a human that understands the context of the sentence consider these popular searches
__label__computers searches out of the google zeitgeist or from ask iq or from yahoo buzz expedia pirates of the caribbean beach game
__label__computers game cheats heidi klum halloween wigs what conceptual analysis are you going to do on them what context from quot beach

__label__computers guess that a user might have these topics in mind the first movie the second movie a computer game the ride
__label__computers ride at disneyland actual pirates that roamed the carribbean there are many more meanings and intentions but natural language analyze the
__label__computers the four words quot pirates of the caribbean quot all you want you won t know exactly what concept someone has
__label__computers has in mind from that analysis you can mind large sets of web data to guess at concepts that s completely
__label__computers completely different than natural language analysis it s also something that s long been in practice with search engines consider this
__label__computers this search for pirates of the caribbean at clusty see how clusty automatically analyzes the web results and produces quot clusters
__label__computers clusters quot or topics click on those and you refine your search results here s the same thing pirates of the
__label__computers the caribbean at ask that s actual conceptual search live in action and on the web now nor is it new
__label__computers new refinement features like this have been available on major search engines in various ways for years to date they ve
__label__computers ve never really taken off i don t know why perhaps presentation could be better sometimes the clustering isn t good
__label__computers good enough alternatively they might just be too weird for users but i know this the completely different type of quot
__label__computers quot conceptual quot searching natural language analysis has never caught on and probably won t for a very long time because
__label__computers because of the limited data searchers provide now let s do the history bit this isn t as comprehensive as i
__label__computers i would like simply because many of the pitches i ve gotten over the years haven t resulted in articles that
__label__computers that s because i already knew the services weren t going anywhere so doing an article wasn t a good investment
__label__computers investment of time still there s plenty left over excite is born with quot intelligent concept extraction quot the pitch being
__label__computers being that excite would know certain words were related to different concepts apple as a fruit versus being a computer company
__label__computers company and that this could be used to improve results excite still operates but fair to say that ice the tech

__label__computers s look at his article for an example of the familiar natural language pitch meaningmaster is generating a lot of buzz
__label__computers buzz in silicon valley yet another overnight sensation that was years in the making meaningmaster is the brainchild of kathleen dahlgren
__label__computers dahlgren a computational linguistics phd who has spent most of her career building a lexicon of the english language this lexicon
__label__computers lexicon is a computer dictionary that is purported to understand the meanings of more than english words in context quot we
__label__computers we model the way people interpret the meanings of a word through context quot says ms dahlgren who is today ceo
__label__computers ceo of meaningmaster quot we search on meaning by using grammar and structure and semantics every word has associated with it
__label__computers it a set of beliefs quot i asked graham spencer to take a look at meaningmaster graham was the chief techie
__label__computers techie at excite where he pioneered yet another search technique involving linguistic vector analysis that still offers some advantages too quot
__label__computers quot it looks interesting quot said graham quot but i found it to have some obvious gaps the problem with any
__label__computers any technology that tries to be explicitly smart is that it has to be really close to perfect or else a
__label__computers a human will notice only time will tell if meaningmaster annoys users or delights them but if its real strength is
__label__computers is for targeted advertising then the annoyance factor could be practically eliminated as long as advertisers were seeing improvements in converting
__label__computers converting clicks into sales that s the real test i haven t heard much about meaningmaster since the company is still
__label__computers still going i notice that contextual ads are one of the solutions it pitches the technology toward that s another familiar
__label__computers familiar theme natural language technology originally designed to help searching ends up being an ad solution microsoft lets us know that
__label__computers that natural language was going to be one of the ways it would kick some google butt from what i wrote
__label__computers wrote about that pitch what about some recent statements by gates about linguistic analysis as a way forward they make a
__label__computers a nice sound bite which is why would be search companies have said the same things in the past but such
__label__computers such efforts have gone nowhere in my view this has been primarily because linguistic analysis of pages or natural language processing
__label__computers processing isn t that important when dealing with the popular short queries people conduct like quot britney spears quot stochasto gets
__label__computers gets some attention for having quot real natural language quot search nevertheless it s another company i haven t heard much
__label__computers much about since kozoru gets lots of attention on a natural language like approach when the attention runs out it turns
__label__computers turns into accusations that google s still checking them out after refusing calls and then how the blogosphere is ignoring them
__label__computers them after being banned from using the google api in june the company finally after a year and a half pushes
__label__computers pushes out a live product for consumers to get answers via instant messaging accoona gets bill clinton out for its launch
__label__computers launch party is part owned by former compaq ceo eckhard pfeiffer and promises to revolutionize how we find information on the
__label__computers the web nevertheless its artificial intelligence natural language searching technology hasn t helped the search engine attract searchers making no real
__label__computers real gains in the us it recently began focusing on europe i really wish i had the time to dive even
__label__computers even deeper into the actual press releases i ve been sent over the years the pitches the promises and so on
__label__computers on suffice to say this any time someone pitches that they have some quot natural language quot revolutionary technology my eyes
__label__computers eyes start to glaze over and my impression is that they know little about how web search actually operates currently and
__label__computers and that brings us to powerset powerset has all the things you want for a start up success story unless you
__label__computers you re pitching to me it s in secret they ve raised million in funding they ve got some prominent names
__label__computers names behind them like esther dyson as an investor more on powerset the secretive search engine from venturebeat covers the back
__label__computers back story i said these things don t work for me that s because i ve already seen prominent investors get
__label__computers get involved with things that failed since they really weren t that useful i especially despise things that are in super
__label__computers super double secret stealth mode you want respect when you haven t already proven yourself in the search world you roll
__label__computers roll out a product that people can play with fairly quickly otherwise you re simply kozuru squandering your initial hype i
__label__computers i m also already put off by the fact that quot natural search quot will be the advanced technique that s
__label__computers s going to have you beat google despite the fact you ve got nothing to analyze and the field is littered
__label__computers littered with other companies who already tried this from powerset itself we ve got barney pell explaining more in the powerset
__label__computers powerset and natural language search on his blog pell does address things i ve already covered people don t enter many
__label__computers many words and that natural search hasn t worked before but he argues still going ahead doesn t defy conventional wisdom
__label__computers wisdom since google did the same thing in challenging the majors not correct google succeeded because the changes it made required
__label__computers required no changes on the part of the user the results simply got better even though the method of searching and
__label__computers and number of words remained the same it also succeeded because all the other major players weren t paying attention to
__label__computers to search believe me they aren t ignoring the idea of natural language search they know about it and if it
__label__computers it will be successful you bet it will be implemented long before an upstart company can try to trounce them back
__label__computers back to pell s post he fails to explain how searchers are somehow magically going to go beyond quot keywordese quot
__label__computers quot to natural language searching they aren t using keywordese now because they somehow have been trained to do it no
__label__computers no one from google sat the searchers down and said quot only two words and don t use conjunctions quot people
__label__computers people search however they want and right now they use only a few words if powerset s going to change those
__label__computers those habits good luck be sure to read my why search sucks amp you won t fix it the way you
__label__computers you think post from last which graphically illustrates the challenge in changing habits with the user interface alone getting inside the
__label__computers the minds and whispering quot type longer quot isn t going to be fun meanwhile i have great sympathy for the
__label__computers the fact that the major search engines could definitely do a much better job with query refinement my robert scoble wants
__label__computers wants what we had better query refinement so do i post from last year drills deep into some of the things
__label__computers things i ve illustrated above on how query refinement could improve and improve in a way that wouldn t cause more
__label__computers more work for the searchers meanwhile i ll leave off with this screenshot that s the top of ask s search
__label__computers search results for the pirates of the caribbean search i mentioned earlier notice what they show before the regular search results

__label__computers wrong notice the quot did you mean quot link directing searchers to try a search on xbox related info as a
__label__computers a backup that s query refinement in action inline directly in front of the action area that most searchers interact with

__label__computers system startup shutdown and power management part every release of windows improves scalability and performance and windows vista is no different
__label__computers different the windows vista memory manager includes numerous enhancements like more extensive use of lock free synchronization techniques finer grained locking
__label__computers locking tighter data structure packing larger paging i os support for modern gpu memory architectures and more efficient use of the
__label__computers the hardware translation lookaside buffer plus windows vista memory management now offers dynamic address space allocation for the requirements of different
__label__computers different workloads four performance enhancing features that use new technologies make their operating system debut on windows vista superfetch readyboost readyboot
__label__computers readyboot and readydrive i ll discuss them in detail later in this article dynamic kernel address space windows and the applications
__label__computers applications that run on it have bumped their heads on the address space limits of bit processors the windows kernel is
__label__computers is constrained by default to gb or half the total bit virtual address space with the other half reserved for use
__label__computers use by the process whose thread is currently running on the cpu inside its half the kernel has to map itself
__label__computers itself device drivers the file system cache kernel stacks per session code data structures and both non paged locked in physical
__label__computers physical memory and paged buffers allocated by device drivers prior to windows vista the memory manager determined at boot time how
__label__computers how much of the address space to assign to these different purposes but this inflexibility sometimes led to situations where one
__label__computers one of the regions became full while others still had plenty of available space the exhaustion of an area can lead
__label__computers lead to application failures and prevent device drivers from completing i o operations in bit windows vista the memory manager dynamically
__label__computers dynamically manages the kernel s address space allocating and deallocating space to various uses as the demands of the workload require
__label__computers require thus the amount of virtual memory used to store paged buffers can grow when device drivers ask for more and
__label__computers and it can shrink when the drivers release it windows vista will therefore be able to handle a wider variety of
__label__computers of workloads and likewise the bit version of the forthcoming windows server code named longhorn will scale to handle more concurrent
__label__computers concurrent terminal server users of course on bit windows vista systems address space constraints are not currently a practical limitation and
__label__computers and therefore require no special treatment as they are configured to their maximums memory priorities just as windows vista adds i
__label__computers i o priorities as i discussed in the last installment it also implements memory priorities understanding how windows uses memory priorities
__label__computers priorities requires grasping how the memory manager implements its memory cache called the standby list on all versions of windows prior
__label__computers prior to windows vista when a physical page which is typically kb in size that s owned by a process was
__label__computers was reclaimed by the system the memory manager typically placed the page at the end of the standby list if the
__label__computers the process wanted to access the page again the memory manager took the page from the standby list and reassigned it
__label__computers it to the process when a process wanted to use a new page of physical memory and no free memory was
__label__computers was available the memory manager gave it the page at the front the standby list this scheme treated all pages on
__label__computers on the standby essentially as equals using only the time they were placed on the list to sort them on windows
__label__computers windows vista every page of memory has a priority in the range of to and so the memory manager divides the
__label__computers the standby list into eight lists that each store pages of a particular priority when the memory manager wants to take
__label__computers take a page from the standby list it pages from low priority lists first a page s priority usually reflects that
__label__computers that of the thread that first causes its allocation if the page is shared it reflects the highest of memory priorities
__label__computers priorities of the sharing threads a thread inherits its page priority value from the process to which it belongs the memory
__label__computers memory manager uses low priorities for pages it reads from disk speculatively when anticipating a process s memory accesses by default
__label__computers default processes have a page priority value of but functions allow applications and the system to change process and thread page
__label__computers page priority values the real power of memory priorities is realized only when the relative priorities of pages are understood at
__label__computers at a macro level which is the role of superfetch superfetch a significant change to the memory manager is in the
__label__computers the way that it manages physical memory the standby list management used by previous versions of windows has two limitations first
__label__computers first the prioritization of pages relies only on the recent past behavior of processes and does not anticipate their future memory
__label__computers memory requirements second the data used for prioritization is limited to the list of pages owned by a process at any
__label__computers any given point in time these shortcomings can result in scenarios like the after lunch syndrome where you leave your computer
__label__computers computer for a while and a memory intensive system application runs such as an antivirus scan or disk defragmentation this application
__label__computers application forces the code and data that your active applications had cached in memory to be over by the memory intensive
__label__computers intensive activities when you return you experience sluggish performance as applications have to request their data and code from disk windows
__label__computers windows xp introduced prefetching support that improved boot and application startup performance by performing large disk i os to preload memory
__label__computers memory with code and file system data that it expected based on previous boots and application launches windows vista goes a
__label__computers a big step further with superfetch a memory management scheme that enhances the least recently accessed approach with historical information and
__label__computers and proactive memory management superfetch is implemented in systemroot system sysmain dll as a windows service that runs inside a service
__label__computers service host process systemroot system svchost exe the scheme relies on support from the memory manager so that it can retrieve
__label__computers retrieve page usage histories as well as direct the memory manager to preload data and code from files on disk or
__label__computers or from a paging file into the standby list and assign priorities to pages the superfetch service essentially extends page tracking
__label__computers tracking to data and code that was once in memory but that the memory manager has reused to make room for
__label__computers for new data and code it stores this information in scenario files with a db extension in the systemroot prefetch directory
__label__computers directory alongside standard prefetch files used to optimize application launch using this deep knowledge of memory usage superfetch can preload data
__label__computers data and code when physical memory becomes available whenever memory becomes free for example when an application exits or releases memory
__label__computers memory superfetch asks the memory manager to fetch data and code that was recently evicted this is done at a rate
__label__computers rate of a few pages per second with very low priority i os so that the preloading does not impact the
__label__computers the user or other active applications therefore if you leave your computer to go to lunch and a memory intensive background
__label__computers background task causes the code and data from your active applications to be evicted from memory while you re gone superfetch
__label__computers superfetch can often bring all or most of it back into memory before you return superfetch also includes specific scenario support
__label__computers support for hibernation standby fast user switching fus and application launch when the system hibernates for example superfetch stores data and
__label__computers and code in the hibernation file that it expects based on previous hibernations will be accessed during the subsequent resume in
__label__computers in contrast when you resume windows xp previously cached data must be reread from the disk when it is referenced see
__label__computers see the sidebar watching superfetch for a glimpse of how superfetch impacts available memory watching superfetch after you ve used a
__label__computers a windows vista system a while you ll see a low number for the free physical memory counter on task manager
__label__computers manager s performance page that s because superfetch and standard windows caching make use of all available physical memory to cache
__label__computers cache disk data for example when you first boot if you immediately run task manager you should notice the free memory
__label__computers memory value decreasing as cached memory number rises or if you run a memory hungry program and then exit it any
__label__computers any of the freeware ram optimizers that allocate large amounts of memory and then release the memory will work or just
__label__computers just copy a very large file the free number will rise and the physical memory usage graph will drop as the
__label__computers the system reclaims the deallocated memory over time however superfetch repopulates the cache with the data that was forced out of
__label__computers of memory so the cached number will rise and the free number will decline watching memory click the image for a
__label__computers a smaller view watching memory click the image for a larger view readyboost the speed of cpus and memory are fast
__label__computers fast outpacing that of hard disks so disks are a common system performance bottleneck random disk i o is especially expensive
__label__computers expensive because disk head seek times are on the order of milliseconds an eternity for today s ghz processors while ram
__label__computers ram is ideal for caching disk data it is relatively expensive flash memory however is generally cheaper and can service random
__label__computers random reads up to times faster than a typical hard disk windows vista therefore includes a feature called readyboost to take
__label__computers take advantage of flash memory storage devices by creating an intermediate caching layer on them that logically sits between memory and
__label__computers and disks readyboost consists of a service implemented in systemroot system emdmgmt dll that runs in a service host process and
__label__computers and a volume filter driver systemroot system drivers ecache sys emd is short for external memory device the working name for
__label__computers for readyboost during its development when you insert a flash device like a usb key into a system the readyboost service
__label__computers service looks at the device to determine its performance characteristics and stores the results of its test in hkey local machine
__label__computers machine software microsoft windows nt currentversion emdmgmt seen in figure figure readyboost device test results in the registry click the image
__label__computers image for a smaller view figure readyboost device test results in the registry click the image for a larger view if
__label__computers if you aren t already using a device for caching and the new device is between mb and gb in size
__label__computers size has a transfer rate of mb s or higher for random kb reads and has a transfer rate of mb
__label__computers mb s or higher for random kb writes then readyboost will ask if you d like to dedicate up to gb
__label__computers gb of the storage for disk caching although readyboost can use ntfs it limits the maximum cache size to gb to
__label__computers to accommodate fat limitations if you agree then the service creates a caching file named readyboost sfcache in the root of
__label__computers of the device and asks superfetch to prepopulate the cache in the background after the readyboost service initializes caching the ecache
__label__computers ecache sys device driver intercepts all reads and writes to local hard disk volumes c for example and copies any data
__label__computers data being into the caching file that the service created ecache sys compresses data and typically achieves a compression ratio so
__label__computers so a gb cache file will usually contain gb of data the driver encrypts each block it writes using advanced encryption
__label__computers encryption standard aes encryption with a randomly generated per boot session key in order to guarantee the privacy of the data
__label__computers data in the cache if the device is removed from the system when readyboost sees random reads that can be satisfied
__label__computers satisfied from the cache it services them from there but because hard disks have better sequential read access than flash memory
__label__computers memory it lets reads that are part of sequential access patterns go directly to the disk even if the data is
__label__computers is in the cache readyboot windows vista uses the same boot time prefetching as windows xp did if the system has
__label__computers has less than mb of memory but if the system has mb or more of ram it uses an in ram
__label__computers ram cache to optimize the boot process the size of the cache depends on the total ram available but is large
__label__computers large enough to create a reasonable cache and yet allow the system the memory it needs to boot smoothly after every
__label__computers every boot the readyboost service the same service that implements the readyboost feature just described uses idle cpu time to calculate
__label__computers calculate a boot time caching plan for the next boot it analyzes file trace information from the five previous boots and
__label__computers and identifies which files were accessed and where they are located on disk it stores the processed traces in systemroot prefetch
__label__computers prefetch readyboot as fx files and saves the caching plan under hklm system currentcontrolset services ecache parameters in reg binary values
__label__computers values named for internal disk volumes they refer to the cache is implemented by the same device driver that implements readyboost
__label__computers readyboost caching ecache sys but the cache s population is guided by the readyboost service as the system boots while the
__label__computers the boot cache is compressed like the readyboost cache another difference between readyboost and readyboot cache management is that while in
__label__computers in readyboot mode other than the readyboost service s updates the cache doesn t change to reflect data that s read

__label__computers the power consumed by the disk drive under normal usage boot configuration database windows vista has enhanced several aspects of startup
__label__computers startup and shutdown startup has improved with the introduction of the boot configuration database bcd for storing system and os startup
__label__computers startup configuration a new flow and organization of system startup processes new logon architecture and support for delayed autostart services windows
__label__computers windows vista shutdown changes include pre shutdown notification for windows services windows services shutdown ordering and a significant change to the
__label__computers the way the os manages power state transitions one of the most visible changes to the startup process is the absence
__label__computers absence of boot ini from the root of the system volume that s because the boot configuration which on previous versions
__label__computers versions of windows was stored in the boot ini text file is now stored in the bcd one of the reasons
__label__computers reasons windows vista uses the bcd is that it unifies the two current boot architectures supported by windows master boot record
__label__computers record mbr and extensible firmware interface efi mbr is generally used by x and x desktop systems while efi is used
__label__computers used by itanium based systems though desktop pcs are likely to ship with efi support in the near future the bcd
__label__computers bcd abstracts the firmware and has other advantages over boot ini like its support for unicode strings and alternate pre boot
__label__computers boot executables the bcd is actually stored on disk in a registry hive that loads into the windows registry for access
__label__computers access via registry apis on pcs windows stores it in boot bcd on the system volume on efi systems it s
__label__computers s on the efi system partition when the hive is loaded it appears under hklm bcd but its internal format is
__label__computers is undocumented so editing it requires the use of a tool like systemroot system bcdedit exe interfaces for manipulating the bcd
__label__computers bcd are also made available for scripts and custom editors through windows management instrumentation wmi and you can use the windows
__label__computers windows system configuration utility systemroot system msconfig exe to edit or add basic parameters like kernel debugging options the bcd divides
__label__computers divides platform wide boot settings like the default os selection and the boot menu timeout from os specific settings such as
__label__computers as os boot options and the path to the os boot loader for example figure shows that when you run bcdedit
__label__computers bcdedit with no command line options it displays platform settings in the windows boot manager section at the top of the

__label__computers a windows vista installation this new scheme divides the tasks that were handled by the operating system loader ntldr on previous
__label__computers previous versions of windows into two different executables bootmgr and systemroot system winload exe bootmgr reads the bcd and displays the
__label__computers the os boot menu while winload exe handles operating system loading if you re performing a clean boot winload exe loads
__label__computers loads boot start device drivers and core operating system files including ntoskrnl exe and transfers control to the operating system if
__label__computers if the system is resuming from hibernation then it executes systemroot system winresume exe to load the hibernation data into memory
__label__computers memory and resume the os bootmgr also includes support for additional pre boot executables windows vista comes with the windows memory
__label__computers memory diagnostic boot memtest exe pre configured as an option for checking the health of ram but third parties can add
__label__computers add their own pre boot executables as options that will display in bootmgr s boot menu startup processes in previous versions
__label__computers versions of windows the relationship between various system processes was unintuitive for example as the system boots the interactive logon manager
__label__computers manager systemroot system winlogon exe launches the local security authority subsystem service lsass exe and the service control manager services exe
__label__computers exe further windows uses a namespace container called a session to isolate processes running in different logon sessions but prior to
__label__computers to windows vista the user logged into the console shared session the session used by system processes which created potential security
__label__computers security issues one such issue was introduced for example when a poorly windows service running in session displayed a user interface
__label__computers interface on the interactive console allowing malware to attack the window through techniques like shatter attacks and possibly gain administrative privileges
__label__computers privileges to address these problems several system processes were re architected for windows vista session manager smss exe is the first
__label__computers first user mode process created during the boot as in previous versions of windows but on windows vista the session manager
__label__computers manager launches a second instance of itself to configure session which is dedicated solely to system processes the session manager process
__label__computers process for session launches the windows startup application wininit exe a windows subsystem process csrss exe for session and then it
__label__computers it exits the windows startup application continues by starting the service control manager the local security authority subsystem and a new
__label__computers new process local session manager lsm exe which manages terminal server connections for the machine when a user logs onto the
__label__computers the system the initial session manager creates a new instance of itself to configure the new session the new smss exe
__label__computers exe process starts a windows subsystem process and winlogon process for the new session having the primary session manager use copies
__label__computers copies of itself to initialize new sessions doesn t offer any advantages on a client system but on windows server longhorn
__label__computers longhorn systems acting as terminal servers multiple copies can run concurrently to allow for faster logon of multiple users with this
__label__computers this new architecture system processes including windows services are isolated in session if a windows service which runs in session displays
__label__computers displays a user interface the interactive services detection service systemroot system ui detect exe notifies any logged on administrator by launching

__label__computers versions of windows the winlogon process loaded the graphical identification and authentication gina dll specified in the registry to display a
__label__computers a logon ui that asked users for their credentials unfortunately the gina model suffers from several limitations including the fact that
__label__computers that only one gina can be configured writing a complete gina is difficult for third parties and custom ginas that have
__label__computers have non standard user interfaces change the windows user experience instead of a gina windows vista uses the new credential provider
__label__computers provider architecture winlogon launches a separate process the logon user interface host logonui exe that loads credential providers that are configured
__label__computers configured in hkey local machine software microsoft windows nt currentversion authentication credential providers logonui can host multiple credential providers concurrently in
__label__computers in fact windows vista ships with interactive authui dll and smartcard smart cardcredentialprovider dll providers to ensure a uniform user experience

__label__computers immediately after it starts you ve probably experienced delays before your desktop is fully configured and you can interact with the
__label__computers the shell and any applications you launch while you re logging on the service control manager is starting the many windows
__label__computers windows services that are configured as automatic start services and therefore activate at boot time many services perform cpu and disk
__label__computers disk intensive initializations that compete with your logon activities to accommodate this windows vista introduces a new service start type called
__label__computers called delayed automatic start which services can use if they don t have to be active immediately after windows boots the
__label__computers the service control manager starts services configured for delayed automatic start after the automatic start services have finished starting and it
__label__computers it sets the priority of their initial thread to thread priority lowest this priority level causes all the disk i o
__label__computers o the thread performs to be very low i o priority after a service finishes initializing the service control manager sets
__label__computers sets its priority to normal the combination of the delayed start low cpu and memory priority and background disk priority greatly
__label__computers greatly reduce interference with a user s logon many windows services including background intelligent transfer windows update client and windows media
__label__computers media center use the new start type to help improve the performance of logons after a boot shutdown a problem that
__label__computers that s plagued windows service writers is that during a windows shutdown they have by default a maximum of twenty seconds
__label__computers seconds to perform cleanup versions of windows prior to windows vista haven t supported a clean shutdown that waits for all
__label__computers all services to exit because a buggy service can hold up a shutdown indefinitely some services like those that have network
__label__computers network related shutdown operations or have to save large amounts of data to disk might require more time and so windows
__label__computers windows vista allows a service to request pre shutdown notification when windows vista shuts down the service control manager first notifies
__label__computers notifies those services asking for pre shutdown notification it will wait indefinitely for these services to exit but if they have
__label__computers have a bug and don t respond to queries the service control manager gives up and moves on after three minutes
__label__computers minutes once all those services have exited or the timeout has expired the service control manager proceeds with legacy style services
__label__computers services shutdown for the rest of the services the group policy and windows update services register pre shutdown notification in a
__label__computers a fresh windows vista installation the group policy and windows update services also use another windows vista services feature shutdown ordering
__label__computers ordering services have always been able to specify startup dependencies that the service control manager honors to start services in an
__label__computers an order that satisfies them but until windows vista they have been unable to specify shutdown dependencies now services that register
__label__computers register for pre shutdown notification can also insert themselves into the list stored at hklm system currentcontrolset control preshutdownorder and the
__label__computers the service control manager will shut them down according to their order see the sidebar identifying a delayed autostart and pre
__label__computers pre shutdown service for more on these services power management sleep and hibernate are other forms of shutdown and buggy power
__label__computers power management in drivers and applications has been the curse of road warriors since windows introduced power management to the windows
__label__computers windows nt based line of windows operating systems many users have expected their laptop system to suspend or hibernate when they
__label__computers they closed the lid before embarking on a trip only to arrive at their destination with a hot carrying case a
__label__computers a dead battery and lost data that s because windows has always asked device drivers and applications for their consent to
__label__computers to change power state and a single unresponsive driver or application could prevent a transition in windows vista the kernel s
__label__computers s power manager still informs drivers and applications of power state changes so that they can prepare for them but it
__label__computers it no longer asks for permission in addition the power manager waits at most seconds for applications to respond to change
__label__computers change notifications rather than the two minutes it waited on previous versions of windows as a result windows vista users can
__label__computers can be more confident that their systems are honoring hibernations and suspends next up as mentioned earlier this is the second
__label__computers second installment in a three part series the first part covered windows vista kernel improvements in the areas of i o

__label__computers strategy already impacting google by emre sokullu and edited by richard macmanus windows vista is finally out and along with that
__label__computers that microsoft seems to have kick started its vista live joint initiative this initiative aims to push microsoft s new web
__label__computers web properties in tandem with their dominant windows operating system and so become a leader in the web industry as well
__label__computers well basically this means that microsoft makes its windows live web properties the default in windows vista pcs where possible for
__label__computers for example live search is the default search engine in ie on new vista machines but the question is will this
__label__computers this strategy be enough for microsoft to beat google and yahoo in the web race or will the average joe and
__label__computers and jane user with their new vista pc make the extra effort to change their default search engine back to google
__label__computers google again in this article we will analyze the early results of microsoft s vista live strategy after the official releases
__label__computers releases of ie and windows vista this year our data source is alexa which is known to be not overly reliable
__label__computers reliable but it is quite adequate when making comparisons between leading sites like google and microsoft before starting with the graphs
__label__computers graphs let s remind you of the official release dates ie was released and offered to the public on november windows
__label__computers windows vista for businesses was made available on november windows vista for consumers was made available on january keeping in mind
__label__computers mind these dates let s take a look at the ing graphs the vertical red lines roughly show windows vista s
__label__computers s release date measuring vista s impact on microsoft web properties live com msn com the graphs above indicate a clear
__label__computers clear gain for microsoft s live and msn in both of the graphs after the red line indicating vista s release
__label__computers release traffic sharply rises shown by the green tangents and interestingly both tangents have the same slope live s slope is
__label__computers is msn s is this hints that the growth in both live and msn are not by chance measuring vista s
__label__computers s impact on google web properties on the other hand google indicates a reverse trend according to alexa there is a
__label__computers a significant fall in google s traffic after vista was released the blue line shows the resistance google s slope is
__label__computers is a negative measuring vista s impact on yahoo web properties yahoo seems to be relatively unaffected although its alexa chart
__label__computers chart has been sloping ever so slightly downward for the past year or two discussion is microsoft pushing google down the
__label__computers the alexa graphs show a clear win situation for microsoft s vista live strategy where live products are the default on
__label__computers on vista machines although it may be too early to judge history repeats itself and people who migrate to vista seem
__label__computers seem happy with what is given as the default i e the default experience is good enough looking at this from
__label__computers from google s perspective though even though vista uses live search as its default in ie making google your default search
__label__computers search engine is just one click away and an alert will display when you visit the google homepage with ie windows
__label__computers windows live is crucial to microsoft in their battle with google as proven by their big internet marketing campaign for live
__label__computers live even though they haven t nailed the branding yet at the same time google s underlying technology pagerank is becoming
__label__computers becoming a commodity yahoo and microsoft are getting closer to google s search quality also open source alternatives like nutch and
__label__computers and dmoz are beginning to blossom similar in a way to windows vs linux in other words the quality gap is
__label__computers is getting negligible between google search and the competition having said that gmail and google office are new ish tools that
__label__computers that can help drive visitors back to google so the battle is happening on many fronts the reason why yahoo seems
__label__computers seems unaffected is obvious yahoo is not in direct competition with microsoft they could even be considered allies yahoo is preferred
__label__computers preferred by consumers for mail finance and other portal products and these products have never really been presented as defaults on
__label__computers on the pc either you visited the sites by yourself or you installed a browser endorsed by yahoo as a final
__label__computers final note alexa competitor compete s results are in parallel with ours according to compete these giants all have an increasing
__label__computers increasing trend in page views but google s slope is apparently lower than those of msn and live what do you
__label__computers you think is microsoft s vista live strategy already beginning to affect google s dominance in search and other web properties
__label__computers properties albeit only with a slight downturn at this point or has google got too much of a lead on the
__label__computers the web for even microsoft s os dominance to turn it around and trend google downwards long term audio digg this

__label__computers subscribe to comments for this post or subscribe to comments for all read writeweb posts i m wondering if google s
__label__computers s slide down after fresh installs of ie is possibly due at least in part to people having the google toolbar
__label__computers toolbar installed in ie and then suddenly not having it in the new computer thus a sharp downward motion for google
__label__computers google while it s replaced by live that being said it would make sense that at least some of these google
__label__computers google toolbar users would reinstall the toolbar at some point many might just think oh well i have something else that
__label__computers that works good enough and never bother to reinstall just something i m thinking but have no idea how it could
__label__computers could be measured of course if google releases an updated toolbar soon it might give some momentum back to them and
__label__computers and we would see that in a graph too posted by devon young february pm i think it is inevitable there
__label__computers there will be some shift from google to microsoft live but how great a shift will come done to a perception
__label__computers perception of how good the search results are in the past weeks i ve noticed at least a doubling of visits
__label__computers visits to my site via live from a tiny base relative to visits via google and still small but a very
__label__computers very noticeable jump my flatmate has had vista also for weeks now and when i ve tried it and when she
__label__computers she uses it we ve just used the default live search to give it a go and think many people will
__label__computers will do this then if they are getting useful results there is less reason for them to put any effort into
__label__computers into changing particularly in the case of the average user additionally personally i am finding a growing number of cases where
__label__computers where i n not getting useful results from a google search today even with changing my search terms couldn t find
__label__computers find what i wanted in the first google results so gave up in the end will have to resort to some
__label__computers some old fashioned telephone research tomorrow posted by bryan jones february pm google has become more arrogant than microsoft in the
__label__computers the last years their adsense policy their search engine deindex bans without valid reasons live has becoming an alternative to google
__label__computers google and with the change from xp to vista that will grow alot more it s time for google treat the
__label__computers the users a little better they must remember that if they have success is only because of the users webmasters of
__label__computers of this world and they are not god i hope that live become a more solid alternative but not to turn
__label__computers turn another google god posted by jonix konios february pm forgot to say something if these graphs are true i believe
__label__computers believe so but i m still skeptic and this trend continues then google may consider a googleos as we described in
__label__computers in our previous articles posted by emre sokullu february pm google is a rotten whore and i sincerely hope they lose
__label__computers lose many market share points to microsoft and others posted by kylie manders february pm wow emre this is great stuff
__label__computers stuff alex posted by alex iskold february pm very compelling thanks for the in depth posted by jim february pm i
__label__computers i am doubting whether microsoft will get sue for monopolizing the os hopefully it will posted by pohee com february am
__label__computers am as far as live search is concerned vista s integration of live search as the default starting in ie should
__label__computers should help so much of search traffic is convenience based users just type whatever search they have in mind in the
__label__computers the first search box in front of them as long as acceptable google and yahoo have made such an effort to
__label__computers to educate users with other choices right from ie serving rich dynamic calls to action to add theirs in the drop
__label__computers drop down i think the jury s still out for sure firefox is doing a lot of good for google as
__label__computers as well now i am not saying that all searches are convenience based many of preference based more emotionally loaded for
__label__computers for searchers that they ll make an effort to go to their primary preferred engine to search arnaud posted by arnnaud
__label__computers arnnaud fischer february am thanks alex and jim pohee i don t think microsoft is monopolizing something here it gives you
__label__computers you the choice to change your search engine with just one click firefox had a default as well but we never
__label__computers never called google monopolist posted by emre sokullu february am ya ll just ain t never gonna learn are ya microsoft
__label__computers microsoft must enjoy being in courtrooms or they have selective memory since this is exactly what got them busted when they
__label__computers they illegally crushed little tiny netscape but this time they are trying to do it to a company with almost unlimited
__label__computers unlimited cash to spend p s there is a pool here in the office to define when microsoft jumped the shark
__label__computers shark some say it was with the zune some say vista i say the point in time when we look back
__label__computers back and say that was the end of microsoft is going to be the zune phone posted by todd february am
__label__computers am interesting post microsoft is definitely having an impact i notice now on my site are coming from microsoft s default

__label__computers by luis february pm good article emre i would like to revisit this analyis in s and see whether the impact

__label__computers a tiny company while microsoft launches the opening salvos of the search engine wars google is apparently ramping up to launch
__label__computers launch a first strike on office s stranglehold so let s watch these too stab each other in the neck and
__label__computers and see who wins posted by daxtermguy february pm our data source is alexa which is known to be not overly
__label__computers overly reliable but it is quite adequate when making comparisons between leading sites like google and microsoft i think you ll
__label__computers ll have to use other sources as well before drawing any firm conclusions posted by juha february pm doh didn t
__label__computers t close the strong tag properly up there sorry about that posted by juha february pm fixed that juha posted by
__label__computers by richard macmanus february pm live hit the market for consumers less than a ago and the trends appear that google
__label__computers google is experiencing the same same downward road it took last year at this time if we attribute this dip in
__label__computers in browsing for google in early to live how can we explain why usership was down first quarter of like anything
__label__computers anything else the trends are set and then observed with the eventual last line finally absorbing the products myself and of
__label__computers of the regular people i know still do not have vista nor have i even seen it used beyond a few
__label__computers few youtube demonstrations as vista comes down in price and more people upgrade their machines to it the next few years
__label__computers years what is the likelihood that the less tech savvy masses many of whom use google but could just as easily
__label__computers easily use anything else will take the time or have the knowledge to switch from live which will already be installed
__label__computers installed and assumably will be good enough and simple enough for their liking posted by ditty february pm i think live
__label__computers live is going to grow in popularity but never beat google posted by edwin february pm does anyone here know how
__label__computers how to get by the activation part of loading internet explorer i have windows xp professional and yeah its a pirated
__label__computers pirated copy posted by ronald february pm this is a very inaccurate interpretation of the alexa graphs you have no explanation
__label__computers explanation for the fall in the google com graph for the first quarter of the trend you describe is non existing
__label__computers existing as this easily could be other factors or natural fluctuations it is in no way correct graph interpretation to zoom
__label__computers zoom in on such a small piece of the graph and only investigate one factor posted by mikkel funck february pm
__label__computers pm i do not like gmail i agree its great application and all the advantages but at the same time i
__label__computers i do not like it when gmail puts all sorts of ads next to my mail depending on its contents its

__label__computers heh yeah and yahoo does just that google for yahoo web beacons and check it out i moderate a yahoo group
__label__computers group for journalists and make a point of reading messages in plain text only no can t move the group before
__label__computers before anyone asks posted by juha february pm mikkel of course we can t say our interpretations are absolutely true and
__label__computers and we already make this disclosure in the introduction but you should admit that it is very likely that these interpretations
__label__computers interpretations are right yes it s too early to judge but ing s will tell if we are right or not
__label__computers not posted by emre sokullu february pm bb why do people like you complain about ads in gmail all free email
__label__computers email providers need ads to sustain the service whats more using firefox you can easily disable ads in gmail using customizegoogle
__label__computers customizegoogle addon stop being a complaining fool and do something about it posted by cali february pm the growth in ms
__label__computers ms traffic is undeniable but you have to be careful here first presidents day and most every change traffic patterns second
__label__computers second people are likely to try new features in vista because they are new that doesn t mean they will stick
__label__computers stick with it posted by alan keister february am you think so maybe affecting google positively the pie is just getting
__label__computers getting bigger and googles piece is big posted by phil b february pm one is not enough statistical evidence to support
__label__computers support a trend posted by erwen tang february pm this analysis isn t very meaningful firstly there aren t enough data
__label__computers data points we are talking less than mths of data and in case of consumer version mth there s no explanation

__label__computers aspect of making and storing private documents on a system that looks at their content who knows what google do with
__label__computers with the info i suspect that the us government have dibs on it just like the phone systems if i were

__label__computers come up with a counter argument but you have no idea what you are talking about sir ionut alex chitu said
__label__computers said on february am yes sir but sharepoint is expensive it requires additional computing power training and it s windows only
__label__computers only maybe a big business can afford that and they ll use sharepoint exchange office but not an ordinary computer user
__label__computers user a non profit organization or a small business the only point of this post was that the comparison between microsoft
__label__computers microsoft office and google docs is completely inadequate i ve just shown you the original intentions of those who built this
__label__computers this useless junk called google docs ionut alex chitu said on february am i can t find a similar software for

__label__computers i second the fact that google docs and spreadsheet is not trying to mimic ms word and ms excel it s
__label__computers s trying to bring useful scenarios to life in the world we live in ms word and ms excel are applications
__label__computers applications of the past it s so true that even office is all about server services sharepoint those who think that
__label__computers that office is about the ribbon have simply read too much of ms marketing blogs google docs and spreadsheets will disrupt
__label__computers disrupt microsoft they have the ability to ship major releases before microsoft releases one and they are lean and mean microsoft

__label__computers programming and rtti since the s c has been one of the most popular commercial programming languages bjarne stroustrup developed c
__label__computers c originally named c with classes in at bell labs as an enhancement to the c language enhancements started with the
__label__computers the addition of classes ed by among other features virtual functions operator overloading multiple inheritance templates and exception handling the c

__label__computers see also more information miscellaneous references external links materials tutorials electronic books support other libraries and code repositories history stroustrup began
__label__computers began work on c with classes in the idea of creating a new language originated from stroustrup s experience in for
__label__computers for his ph d thesis stroustrup found that simula had features that were very helpful for large software development but the
__label__computers the language was too slow for practical use while bcpl was fast but too low level and unsuitable for large software
__label__computers software development when stroustrup started working in bell labs he had the problem of analyzing the unix kernel with respect to
__label__computers to distributed computing remembering his ph d experience stroustrup set out to enhance the c language with simula like features c
__label__computers c was chosen because it is general purpose fast and portable besides c and simula some other languages which inspired him
__label__computers him were algol ada clu and ml at first the class derived class strong type checking inlining and default argument features
__label__computers features were added to c via cfront the first commercial release occurred in october in the name of the language was
__label__computers was changed from c with classes to c new features were added including virtual functions function name and operator overloading references
__label__computers references constants user controlled free store memory control improved type checking and a new single line comment style with two forward
__label__computers forward slashes in the first edition of the c language was released providing an important reference to the language as there
__label__computers there was not yet an official standard in release of c was released new features included multiple inheritance abstract classes static
__label__computers static member functions const member functions and protected members in the annotated c reference manual was published this work became the
__label__computers the basis for the future standard late addition of features included templates exceptions namespaces new casts and a boolean type as
__label__computers as the c language evolved a standard library also evolved with it the first addition to the c standard library was
__label__computers was the stream i o library which provided facilities to replace the traditional c functions such as printf and scanf later
__label__computers later among the most significant additions to the standard library was the standard template library after years of work a joint
__label__computers joint ansi iso committee standardized c in iso iec for some years after the official release of the standard in the
__label__computers the committee processed defect reports and published a corrected version of the c standard in in a technical report called the
__label__computers the library technical report often known as tr for short was released while not an official part of the standard it
__label__computers it gives a number of extensions to the standard library which are expected to be included in the next version of
__label__computers of c support for tr is growing in almost all currently maintained c compilers while the c language is royalty free
__label__computers free the standard document itself is not freely available the name c this name is credited to rick mascitti mid and
__label__computers and was first used in december earlier during the research period the developing language had been referred to as new c
__label__computers c then c with classes in computer science c is still referred to as a superstructure of c the final name
__label__computers name stems from c s operator which increments the value of a variable and a common naming convention of using to
__label__computers to indicate an enhanced computer program according to stroustrup the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from c c
__label__computers c was the name of an earlier unrelated language stroustrup addressed the origin of the name in the preface of later
__label__computers later editions of his book the c language adding that c might be inferred from the appendix of george orwell s
__label__computers s nineteen eighty four of the three segments of the fictional language newspeak the c vocabulary is the one dedicated to
__label__computers to technical terms and jargon doubleplus is the superlative modifier for newspeak adjectives thus c might hold the meaning most extremely
__label__computers extremely technical or jargonous in newspeak when rick mascitti was questioned informally in about the naming he indicated that it was
__label__computers was given in a tongue in cheek spirit he never thought that it would become the formal name of the language
__label__computers language a common joke of the name is that in c when you postfix the addition happens only after the operation
__label__computers operation hence it should be c and not c future development c continues to evolve to meet future requirements one group
__label__computers group in particular boost org works to make the most of c in its current form and advises the c standards
__label__computers standards committee as to which features work well and which need improving current work indicates that c will capitalize on its
__label__computers its multi paradigm nature more and more the work at boost for example is greatly expanding c s functional and metaprogramming
__label__computers metaprogramming capabilities a new version of the c standard is currently being worked on entitled c x denoting the fact it
__label__computers it is expected to be released before which will include a number of new features philosophy in the design and evolution
__label__computers evolution of c bjarne stroustrup describes some rules that he uses for the design of c knowing the rules helps to
__label__computers to understand why c is the way it is the ing is a summary of the rules much more detail can
__label__computers can be found in the design and evolution of c c is designed to be a statically typed general purpose language
__label__computers language that is as efficient and portable as c c is designed to directly and comprehensively support multiple styles procedural data
__label__computers data abstraction object oriented programming and generic c is designed to give the programmer choice even if this makes it possible
__label__computers possible for the programmer to choose incorrectly c is designed to be as compatible with c as possible therefore providing a
__label__computers a smooth transition from c c avoids features that are platform specific or not general purpose c does not incur overhead
__label__computers overhead for features that are not used c is designed to function without a sophisticated environment stanley b lippman describes various
__label__computers various models in his in depth book inside the c object model for how compilers may convert c program statements into
__label__computers into an in memory layout compiler vendors are free to implement the standard in their own manner lippman worked on implementing
__label__computers implementing and maintaining cfront the original c implementation at bell labs standard library the c standard consists of two parts the
__label__computers the core language and the c standard library the latter includes most of the standard template library and a slightly modified
__label__computers modified version of the c standard library many c libraries exist which are not part of the standard and using external
__label__computers external linkage libraries can even be in c the c standard library incorporates the c standard library with some small modifications
__label__computers modifications to make it work better with the c language another large part of the c library is based on the
__label__computers the standard template library stl this provides such useful tools as containers for example vectors and lists iterators generalized pointers to
__label__computers to provide these containers with array like access and algorithms to perform operations such as searching and sorting furthermore multi maps
__label__computers maps associative arrays and multi sets are provided all of which export compatible interfaces therefore it is possible using templates to
__label__computers to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators as in c the features
__label__computers features of the library are accessed by using the include directive to include a standard header c provides sixty nine standard
__label__computers standard headers of which nineteen are deprecated using the standard library for example using std vector or std string instead of
__label__computers of a c style array can help lead to safer and more scalable software the stl was originally a third party
__label__computers party library from hp and later sgi before its incorporation into the c standard the standard does not refer to it
__label__computers it as stl as it is merely a part of the standard library but many people still use that term to
__label__computers to distinguish it from the rest of the library input output streams internationalization diagnostics the c library subset etc most c
__label__computers c compilers provide an implementation of the c standard library including the stl compiler independent implementations of the stl such as
__label__computers as stlport also exist other projects also produce various custom implementations of the c standard library and the stl with various
__label__computers various design goals features introduced in c compared to the c language c introduced extra features including declarations as statements function
__label__computers function like casts new delete bool reference types inline functions default arguments function overloading namespaces classes including all class related features
__label__computers features such as inheritance member functions virtual functions abstract classes and constructors operator overloading templates the operator exception handling and runtime
__label__computers runtime type identification contrary to popular belief c did not introduce the const keyword first const was formally added to c
__label__computers c shortly before it was adopted by c c also performs more type checking than c in several cases see incompatibility
__label__computers incompatibility with c below comments starting with two slashes were originally part of c s predecessor bcpl and were reintroduced in
__label__computers in c several features of c were later adopted by c including declarations in for loops c style comments using the
__label__computers the symbol and inline though the c definition of the inline keyword is not compatible with its c definition however c
__label__computers c also introduced features that do not exist in c such as variadic macros and better handling of arrays as parameters
__label__computers parameters some c compilers may implement some of these features as extensions but others are incompatible with existing c features a
__label__computers a very common source of confusion is a subtle terminology issue because of its derivation from c in c the term
__label__computers term object means memory area just like in c and not class instance which is what it means in most other
__label__computers other object oriented languages for example in both c and c the statement int i defines an object of type int
__label__computers int that is the memory area where the value of the variable i will be stored on assignment incompatibility with c
__label__computers c for more details on this topic see compatibility of c and c c is often considered to be a superset
__label__computers superset of c but this is not strictly true most c code can easily be made to compile correctly in c
__label__computers c but there are a few differences that cause some valid c code to be invalid in c or to behave
__label__computers behave differently in c perhaps the most commonly encountered difference is that c allows implicit conversion from void to other pointer
__label__computers pointer types but c does not so the ing is valid c code int i malloc sizeof int implicit conversion from
__label__computers from void to int but to make it work in both c and c one would need to use an explicit
__label__computers explicit cast int i int malloc sizeof int another common portability issue is that c defines many new keywords such as
__label__computers as new and class that may be used as identifiers e g variable names in a c program some incompatibilities have
__label__computers have been removed by the latest c c standard which now supports c features such as comments and mixed declarations and
__label__computers and code however c introduced a number of new features that conflict with c such as variable length arrays native complex
__label__computers complex number types and compound literals so the languages may be diverging more than they are converging in order to intermix
__label__computers intermix c and c code any c code which is to be called from used in c must be put in
__label__computers in extern c c code sample code minimal program this is an example of a program which does nothing it begins
__label__computers begins executing and immediately terminates it consists of one thing a main function the function main is the designated start of
__label__computers of a c program in more complex c programs code can be executed before main begins for example the constructors of
__label__computers of all global variables are run first there can be only one main function in a program notes on compiler issues
__label__computers issues even though the latest c standard does not require a return in main some older compilers such as microsoft visual
__label__computers visual c give warnings or errors for a main without a return statement and may not generate correct object code int
__label__computers int main the c standard requires that main returns type int a program which uses any other return type for main
__label__computers main is technically not standard c although many compilers do not enforce this strictly the standard also does not say what
__label__computers what the return value of main actually means traditionally it is interpreted as the return value of the program itself the
__label__computers the standard guarantees that returning zero or the macro exit success from main indicates successful termination unsuccessful termination can be indicated
__label__computers indicated by returning the macro exit failure all other values are implementation defined this allows each operating system to define these
__label__computers these values differently if as in this example execution reaches the end of main without encountering a return statement zero is
__label__computers is returned implicitly only the main function has this implicit return statement in any other non void function reaching the end
__label__computers end of the function without meeting a return statement is undefined behavior hello world program this is an example of a
__label__computers a hello world program which uses the c standard library not the standard template library stl cout facility to display a
__label__computers a message then terminates notes on include lt ostream gt an additional include lt ostream gt directive may be necessary with
__label__computers with some obscure c implementations this is due to the fact that while the c iso standard requires that the standard
__label__computers standard header iostream declares the object std cout to be an instance of the standard class ostream it does not demand
__label__computers demand that iostream defines the class std ostream and the operations associated with it include lt iostream gt for std cout
__label__computers cout using namespace std c programmers make use of using namespace lt name gt known as a using directive which imports
__label__computers imports all symbols from the target namespace into the current namespace in this example using namespace std allows for unqualified access
__label__computers access to all the standard library names so that std cout can be shortened to cout widespread use of the global
__label__computers global using namespace directive is generally discouraged because importation of a large number of names may result in global namespace pollution
__label__computers pollution this is especially true in header files which are included across many compilation units for this reason a more restricted
__label__computers restricted using declaration may be used to import only the required names without importing the entire namespace in the example above
__label__computers above the using namespace std may be replaced with using declarations as s using std cout using std endl for more
__label__computers more examples see c examples language features operators main article operators in c and c preprocessor c is principally compiled in
__label__computers in three phases preprocessing translation to object code and linking the two last phases are what is generally thought of as
__label__computers as the compilation proper in the first phase preprocessing preprocessor directives apply lexical transformations to the source code which is then
__label__computers then fed to the next compilation stage preprocessor directives and macros pre processing directives work by simple substitution of tokenized character
__label__computers character sequences for other tokenized character sequences according to user defined rules they typically perform macro substitution inclusion of other files
__label__computers files by opposition to higher order features such as inclusion of modules packages units components conditional compilation and or conditional inclusion
__label__computers inclusion for instance define pi every time pi appears in the source code it will be replaced with another common example
__label__computers example is include lt iostream gt which includes imports all symbols from the standard library header file iostream in addition to
__label__computers to the most common directives mentioned above there are several additional preprocessor directives that control the flow of compilation conditionally include
__label__computers include or exclude code blocks and control various other aspects of compilation also see preprocessor and c preprocessor templates templates are
__label__computers are different from macros while both of these compile time language features can be used to produce conditional compilation templates are
__label__computers are not restricted to lexical substitution templates have an awareness of the semantics and type system of their companion language as
__label__computers as well as all compile time type definitions and can perform high level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation
__label__computers evaluation of strictly type checked parameters macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria but cannot instantiate
__label__computers instantiate new types recurse or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre compilation text substitution and text inclusion
__label__computers inclusion exclusion in other words macros can control compilation flow based on pre defined symbols but cannot unlike templates independently instantiate
__label__computers instantiate new symbols templates are a tool for static polymorphism see below and generic this can be found in the algorithm
__label__computers algorithm header as std max in addition templates are a compile time mechanism in c which is turing complete meaning that
__label__computers that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed in some form by a template metaprogram prior to runtime
__label__computers runtime see also generic and template metaprogramming objects c introduces some object oriented oo features to c it offers classes which
__label__computers which provide the four features commonly present in oo and some non oo languages abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism objects are
__label__computers are set by classes which are basically like a set of attributes already defined and can be created at any time
__label__computers time encapsulation encapsulation is the grouping together of data and functionality c implements encapsulation by allowing all members of a class
__label__computers class to be declared as either public private or protected a public member of the class will be accessible to any
__label__computers any function a private member will only be accessible to functions that are members of that class and to functions and
__label__computers and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class friends a protected member will be accessible to members of classes that
__label__computers that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends the oo principle is that all and
__label__computers and only the functions that can access the internal representation of a type should be encapsulated within the type definition c
__label__computers c supports this via member functions and friend functions but does not enforce it the programmer can declare parts or all
__label__computers all of the representation of a type to be public and is also allowed to make public entities that are not
__label__computers not part of the representation of the type because of this c supports not just oo programming but other weaker decomposition
__label__computers decomposition paradigms like modular programming it is generally considered good practice to make all data private or protected and to make
__label__computers make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class that hides implementation details
__label__computers details inheritance inheritance allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types inheritance from a base class may be
__label__computers be declared as public protected or private this access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public
__label__computers public and protected members of the base class only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by inheritance the other
__label__computers other two forms are much less frequently used if the access specifier is omitted inheritance is assumed to be private for
__label__computers for a class base and public for a struct base base classes may be declared as virtual this is called virtual
__label__computers virtual inheritance virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph avoiding some of
__label__computers of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance multiple inheritance is a c feature sometimes considered controversial multiple inheritance allows a class
__label__computers class to be derived from more than one base class this can result in a complicated graph of inheritance relationships for
__label__computers for example a flying cat class can inherit from both cat and flying mammal some other languages such as c or
__label__computers or java accomplish something similar although more limited by allowing inheritance of multiple interfaces while restricting the number of base classes
__label__computers classes to one interfaces unlike classes provide only declarations of member functions no implementation or member data polymorphism see also polymorphism
__label__computers polymorphism in object oriented programming polymorphism computer science enables one common interface for many implementations and for objects to act different
__label__computers different under different circumstances c supports several kinds of static compile time and dynamic run time polymorphism compile time polymorphism does
__label__computers does not allow for certain run time decisions while run time polymorphism typically incurs a performance penalty static polymorphism function overloading
__label__computers overloading function overloading allows programs to declare multiple functions with the same name the functions are distinguished by the number and
__label__computers and or types of their formal parameters thus the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context
__label__computers context in which it is used the type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions operator overloading
__label__computers overloading similarly operator overloading allows programs to define certain operators such as lt or amp to result in a function call
__label__computers call that depends on the types of the operands they are used on class and function templates templates in c provide
__label__computers provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic polymorphic code in particular through the curiously recurring template pattern it s possible to
__label__computers to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual methods a dynamic polymorphism technique described
__label__computers described below since c templates are type aware and turing complete they can also be used to let the compiler resolve
__label__computers resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through template metaprogramming dynamic polymorphism polymorphism through inheritance variable pointers and references of a
__label__computers a base class type in c can refer to objects of any derived classes of that type in addition to objects
__label__computers objects exactly matching the variable type this allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing
__label__computers differing types because assignment of values to variables usually occurs at run time this is necessarily a run time phenomenon c
__label__computers c also provides a dynamic cast operator which allows the program to safely attempt conversion of an object into an object
__label__computers object of a more specific object type as opposed to conversion to a more general type which is always allowed this
__label__computers this feature relies on run time type information rtti objects known to be of a certain specific type can also be
__label__computers be cast to that type with static cast a purely compile time construct which is faster and does not require rtti
__label__computers rtti virtual member functions through virtual member functions different objects that share a common base class may all support an operation
__label__computers operation in different ways the member functions implemented by the derived class are said to override the same member functions of
__label__computers of the base class in contrast with function overloading the parameters for a given member function are always exactly the same
__label__computers same in number and type only the type of the object for which this method is called varies in addition to
__label__computers to standard member functions operator overloads and destructors can also be virtual by virtue of inherited objects being polymorphic it may
__label__computers may not be possible for the compiler to determine the type of the object at compile time the decision is therefore
__label__computers therefore put off until runtime and is called dynamic dispatch in this way the most specific implementation of the function is
__label__computers is called according to the actual run time type of the object in c this is commonly done using virtual function
__label__computers function tables this may sometimes be bypassed by prepending a fully qualified class name before the function call but calls to
__label__computers to virtual functions are in general always resolved at run time this example program makes use of virtual functions polymorphism and
__label__computers and inheritance to derive new more specific objects from a base class in this case the base class is a bird
__label__computers bird and the more specific swan is made parsing and processing c source code it is relatively difficult to write a
__label__computers a good c parser with classic parsing algorithms such as lalr see this is partly because the c grammar is not
__label__computers not lalr because of this there are very few tools for analyzing or performing non trivial transformations e g refactoring of
__label__computers of existing code one way to handle this difficulty is to choose a different syntax such as significantly prettier and easier
__label__computers easier c syntax which is lalr parseable parsing in the literal sense of producing a syntax tree is not the most
__label__computers most difficult problem in building a c processing tool such tools must also have the same understanding of the meaning of
__label__computers of the identifiers in the program as a compiler might have practical systems for processing c must then not only parse
__label__computers parse the source text but be able to resolve for each identifier precisely which identifier definition applies e g correctly handle
__label__computers handle c s complex scoping rules but must also be able to determine the type of each identifer and expression finally
__label__computers finally a practical c processing tool must be able to handle the variety of c dialects used in practice gnu microsoft
__label__computers microsoft but also implement appropriate analyzers source code transformers and regenerate source text combining advanced parsing algorithms such as glr with
__label__computers with symbol table construction and program transformation machinery can enable the construction of arbitrary c tools problems and controversies c has
__label__computers has been the subject of debate traditionally c compilers have had a range of problems the c standard does not cover
__label__computers cover implementation of name mangling exception handling and other implementation specific features making object code produced by different compilers incompatible there
__label__computers there are however third party standards for particular machines or operating systems which attempt to standardize compilers on those platforms for
__label__computers for example c abi some compilers adopt a secondary standard for these items for many years different c compilers implemented the
__label__computers the c language to different levels of compliance to the standard and their implementations varied widely in some areas such as
__label__computers as partial template specialization recent releases of most popular c compilers support almost all of the c standard one particular point
__label__computers point of contention is the export keyword intended to allow template definitions to be separated from their declarations the first compiler
__label__computers compiler to implement export was comeau c in early years after the release of the standard in the beta compiler of
__label__computers of borland c builder x was also released with export both of these compilers are based on the edg c front
__label__computers front end it should also be noted that many c books provide example code for implementing the keyword export for example
__label__computers example beginning ansi c by ivor horton which will not compile but there is no reference to the problem with the
__label__computers the keyword export mentioned other compilers such as gcc do not support it at all herb sutter secretary of the c
__label__computers c standards committee recommended that export be removed from future versions of the c standard but finally the decision was made
__label__computers made to leave it in the c standard modern critics of the language raise several points first since c is based
__label__computers based on and largely compatible with c it inherits most of the criticisms levelled at that language taken as a whole
__label__computers whole c has a large feature set including all of c plus a large set of its own additions in part
__label__computers part leading to criticisms of being a bloated and complicated language especially for embedded systems due to features such as exceptions
__label__computers exceptions and rtti which add to code size however every compiler allows the developer to disable exceptions if desired bjarne stroustrup
__label__computers stroustrup also points out that resultant executables don t support these claims of bloat i have even seen the c version
__label__computers version of the hello world program smaller than the c version the embedded c standard was specified to deal with part
__label__computers part of this but it received criticism for leaving out useful parts of the language that incur no runtime penalty because
__label__computers because of its large featureset it can be quite difficult to fully master c leading to programmers often bringing unnecessarily advanced
__label__computers advanced or complicated solutions to simple problems while c is more complex than some other programming languages bjarne stroustrup points out
__label__computers out that the programming world is far more complex today than it was years ago and modern programming languages reflect that
__label__computers that the iso standard of the c language is about pages excluding library for comparison the c programming language s is
__label__computers is about pages even though it was designed more than years prior and doesn t consider object oriented programming furthermore c
__label__computers c s ecma language definition document is about pages c is also sometimes compared unfavorably with single paradigm object oriented languages
__label__computers languages such as java on the basis that it allows programmers to mix and match object oriented and procedural programming rather
__label__computers rather than strictly enforcing a single paradigm this is part of a wider debate on the relative merits of the two

__label__computers the first points mentioned is that swing is lightweight what this essentially means is that there are no real native controls
__label__computers controls behind swing buttons internal frames and menus everything is controlled in pure java including rendering and event handling while this
__label__computers this provides a much more flexible way to create truly platform independent components the task of creating a custom swing component
__label__computers component that has a consistent look across all platforms and look and feels is not an easy one this article walks
__label__computers walks through the process of creating a new swing component of medium complexity and highlights the important points steps and pitfalls
__label__computers pitfalls along the way basic building blocks the swing architecture overview provides an excellent high level overview of the architectural decisions
__label__computers decisions that were made during the development of swing although it will take slightly more work to create a new component
__label__computers component ing the rules outlined in this article the resulting code will be much easier to maintain since it will adhere
__label__computers adhere to the core swing principles without reinventing the wheel at the first look you might be tempted to throw everything
__label__computers everything together in one single class that will provide the external api the model handling state and notifications event handling layout
__label__computers layout and painting all these however belong in separate classes that the modified mvc model view controller architecture that will make
__label__computers make your component codebase much easier to maintain and extend in the long run the main building blocks of all core
__label__computers core swing components are the component class itself which provides an api for creating changing and querying the component basic state

__label__computers creating a custom component that is based on the new view slider from microsoft windows vista os explorer see figure while
__label__computers while this component looks very much like a slider embedded in a pop up menu it has new features that are
__label__computers are not available on a regular jslider first it has control points that have associated icons and labels in addition while
__label__computers while some ranges are contiguous like small icons medium icons and allow continuous resizing of the file icons other ranges are
__label__computers are discrete like tiles details when the value is in one of these ranges the slider thumb can be only at
__label__computers at control points and not inside the range figure view slider in microsoft windows vista os the component class ui delegate
__label__computers delegate plumbing the first class for a custom component is the component api itself the api should be as simple as
__label__computers as possible and delegate most of the business logic to the model see the next section in addition to the api
__label__computers api you should add the boilerplate code for setting the proper ui delegate described in detail in the enhancing swing applications
__label__computers applications article at the barest level this code should look like this expose your pojo based domain apps as web services
__label__computers services combine axis the next generation web services api of apache axis with spring to expose pojo based domain tier applications
__label__computers applications as both rest and soap based web services by ramanujam a rao february he growing acceptance of loosely coupled services
__label__computers services in enterprise application development and the continuing buzz around service oriented architecture soa has created substantial momentum in enterprises for
__label__computers for consumable services which can be invoked and utilized remotely the significance and value of soap based web services as a
__label__computers a medium for achieving a services driven architecture have also gained wide acceptance during the past few years web services can
__label__computers can be created in several ways but enterprises typically have a substantial investment in existing applications that house business functions therefore
__label__computers therefore they need a design that allows for their domain functions to be easily efficiently and securely exposed as web services
__label__computers services this article explains how to expose existing pojo driven j ee applications as web services using axis while still providing
__label__computers providing enough room for scalability it describes leveraging spring which already serves as the underlying dependency injection container for many j
__label__computers j ee applications today to further facilitate the creation and control of these services finally it discusses deployment strategies for axis
__label__computers axis enterprise web services and lists the specific concerns with certain application servers such as ibm websphere the application a typical
__label__computers typical j ee application is usually tiered with distinct presentation and business domain tiers either custom factories controllers or frameworks such
__label__computers such as spring are used to tie all the components together take for example an application with a simple web tier
__label__computers tier and a domain tier that encapsulates the business logic for the sake of simplicity the example application in this article
__label__computers article combines the web tier and the domain in the same project structure even though in reality these are distinct figure
__label__computers figure shows the structure of the sample application accountweb figure existing application structure the application has a domain function called accountmanager
__label__computers accountmanager which serves the front end accountmanager is implemented as accountmanagerimpl and uses the domain object account again for convenience it
__label__computers it has hard coded logic and returns values based on variable pre determined input a typical application would have a full
__label__computers full fledged domain business tier with data access and integration components providing data as its domain logic interface shows accountmanager has
__label__computers has two methods public interface accountmanager public account getaccount string accountid public void setstatus string accountid boolean status the remainder of
__label__computers of the article demonstrates how to expose the accountmanager function and both of its methods as externally consumable web services using
__label__computers using axis and spring creating web services using axis a web service consists of provider side code called skeletons and consumer
__label__computers consumer side segments called stubs stubs and skeletons are used for marshalling and unmarshalling requests hence the first step here is
__label__computers is creating producer side components for your service you can create a web service using a bottom up or top down
__label__computers down approach in a bottom up approach you create java classes and then generate a service descriptor wsdl from it with
__label__computers with a top down approach you create a wsdl and generate java classes from it since you already have your business
__label__computers business function in the form of java classes in the example application you will use the bottom up approach axis supports
__label__computers supports both synchronous and asynchronous services this example utilizes only synchronous services the ing steps summarize the procedure for creating a
__label__computers a web service from existing domain classes using axis and spring generate wsdl from the current implementation generate producer side skeletons
__label__computers skeletons and client side stubs from the wsdl configure the spring wiring and edit the skeleton implementation to hook to the
__label__computers the existing classes once the services are created and configured you will need to do the ing deploy the service test
__label__computers test it with a client before going any further you need to download axis binaries and install them in the library
__label__computers library directory of the application in the classpath with certain application servers such as websphere and weblogic these libraries can cause
__label__computers cause conflicts with the default libraries provided by the server later sections on deployment will delve into this in a bit
__label__computers bit more detail for now it will suffice to know that you can resolve these conflicts by manipulating the classloaders and

__label__computers code using our javascript native interface jsni java from jump to navigation search lisp function eval itself to machine code debugged
__label__computers debugged it and obtained an interpreter for lisp programs in s expression form people could then enter program code as s
__label__computers s expression test it and not have to worry anymore about the tedious error prone process of translating programs manually into
__label__computers into machine code thus was started the tradition of using the data syntax subset for writing actual code so as to
__label__computers to use a very useful metaprogram the interpreter itself made possible by the universal nature of the language the m expression
__label__computers expression survived for some time at least in paper documentation and usage m now stood for meta more so than for
__label__computers for mathematical because it was used in the metalanguage of lisp but in the end the use of the data syntax
__label__computers syntax stuck because it was found to be actually more natural just what is so great about having a data syntax
__label__computers syntax for code the ability to easily write metaprograms that is programs that manipulate other programs by seamlessly turning data into
__label__computers into code and code into data this makes it easy to experiment with variants and extensions of the language whereas lisp
__label__computers lisp started as kind of a functional programming language it could and did easily absorb imperative programming structured programming object oriented
__label__computers oriented programming graphical user interfaces pattern matching logic distributed dynamic web applications etc as soon as someone somewhere invented any feasible
__label__computers feasible paradigm said paradigm could easily be imported into lisp whereas a non lisper inventor of some idea would maybe with
__label__computers with a lot of effort after many years build a full fledged language from scratch around his one paradigm lispers could
__label__computers could with comparatively little incremental effort support the same paradigm as the extension of a one environment that also supported all
__label__computers all the previously invented paradigms and that would also support all the future paradigms whenever these would be invented and of
__label__computers of course while experimenting lispers are not limited to an all or nothing approach of language selection but can explore all
__label__computers all kinds of language features and ways to combine them and get an actual running language implementation for each combination for
__label__computers for instance while experimenting with the scheme dialect of lisp steele and sussman were reportedly writing as many as ten interpreters
__label__computers interpreters a week by contrast non lispers may require weeks s or years between each actually tested iteration of their language
__label__computers language design process this allows lisp to benefit from a language design experience beyond anything that has ever been tried with
__label__computers with any other programming language lisp was the only intrinsically programmable programming language now just any universal programming language can be
__label__computers be encoded so that code can be included and manipulated as data by programs in the same language and indeed most
__label__computers most serious programming languages end up being implemented by a compiler in same language after a phase of bootstrap from a
__label__computers a different metalanguage using the very same technique used with lisp between and in any case any language implementation supposes that
__label__computers that a mechanism is provided by which programs can be practically encoded as data if only as a data stream from
__label__computers from user input to be directly interpreted or compiled without intermediate representation thus any language is at least in theory and
__label__computers and at least in some contorted practical way fit for metaprogramming however lisp still possesses quite an edge in this regard
__label__computers regard which is intimately tied to its very distinctive characteristic the encoding of code as nested lists of symbols and other
__label__computers other data firstly this encoding of code as data is well defined as part of the language itself this means that
__label__computers that there is a common standard representation that serves as the basis for development of metaprograms by anyone by contrast in
__label__computers in other languages every would be metaprogrammer has to start from scratch and sharing his metacode with other people will be
__label__computers be hampered because encoding is implementation dependent subject to changes restricted by intellectual property barriers etc this restrains considerably the potential
__label__computers potential for human collaboration about metaprograms secondly the lisp encoding of code as nested lists is very simple and powerful the
__label__computers the choice of a single universal and versatile data structure means that it is very easy to write metaprograms both from
__label__computers from lisp and to lisp as said alan perlis it is better to have functions operate on one data structure than
__label__computers than functions on data structures the overhead for writing metaprograms in lisp is thus very low as compared to what you
__label__computers you have in about any other language there is opportunity for writing code that is both shorter and more widely applicable
__label__computers applicable than in other languages less expensive and more valuable thirdly the natural mapping between the nested list structure of code
__label__computers code as data and the semantics of said code also contribute to making metaprogramming simple the recursive evaluation model where all
__label__computers all expressions yield values makes it much simpler to manipulate programs than the common dual statements vs expressions model found in
__label__computers in most other languages more generally the lisp grammar has two non terminals pairs and atoms where other languages commonly have
__label__computers have a lot of non terminals that lead to a combinatorial explosion for metaprograms the ability to locally define lexical dynamic
__label__computers dynamic and syntactic bindings as well as higher order functions method combinations and many other features also allow for local code
__label__computers code transformations to be much more expressive than they could possibly be in other languages where the same effects would require
__label__computers require global program rewrite lisp code can thus be factored in much nicer ways than code in other languages fourthly because
__label__computers because lisp code can be compiled efficiently and dynamically it is not only easy but also efficient to use lisp as
__label__computers as the target for metaprograms in other languages people have to use slow interpreters or to target special purpose virtual machines
__label__computers machines when generating code dynamically because dynamic production linkage and execution of code is so difficult interestingly technical difficulties with these
__label__computers these languages can often be overcome at the price of bulk slowness unsafety and various limitations but intellectual property restrictions on
__label__computers on the availability and use of the compiler and linker make these techniques impossible to use on the mainstream of computers
__label__computers computers running proprietary systems with mainstream languages quasiquotation allows one to easily write templates of data including most particularly code representation
__label__computers representation where part of the structure is fixed whereas other parts are computed the syntax is almost the same as for
__label__computers for quoted data except for unquotes at places where the structure is not fixed and computation is to happen quasiquotes can
__label__computers can be nested which allows for meta meta programs or meta n programs interestingly quasiquotation is a concept independent from the
__label__computers the actual representation of programs it helps abstract away from the fact that programs be encoded as lists or otherwise it
__label__computers it gets even better when it can be used for matching code as well as for generating code lists are still
__label__computers still useful though and so are straight quotes in combination with quasiquotes lists allow to handle the variable part of program
__label__computers program patterns and quotes are instrumental in distinguishing levels of nested unquotation thus it is unclear whether use of quasiquotation in
__label__computers in other languages matches the utility of quasiquotation in lisp a notable exception is slate which with tagged quasiquotation can do
__label__computers do unquotation in a clearer and more powerful way than is possible in straight lisp though lisp can be extended to
__label__computers to match this feature also interestingly the discovery of quasiquotation and the power unleashed by nesting it and combining it with
__label__computers with quote is tied to the existence of quote and hence to the specifically lispy tradition of a separate data syntax
__label__computers syntax last but not least the lisp language also includes a lot of reflective infrastructure from boundp to get setf expander
__label__computers expander to the clos mop that allows one to write language extensions that take advantage of each other instead of being
__label__computers being mutually incompatible as happens in so many other languages in any mainstream language language extension implies having mutually incompatible new
__label__computers new compilers for each set of new features by contrast language extension in lisp is a matter of using components that
__label__computers that most of the time interoperate out of the box you may have to ensure that globally rewriting metaprograms are run
__label__computers run in the right order but this is intrinsic to the problem of combining such metaprograms and the infrastructure of lisp
__label__computers lisp makes such problems far less frequent than in other languages the worst you usually have to do is to ensure
__label__computers ensure that symbols are interned in the right package in conclusion unlike most other languages lisp is not an arbitrary design
__label__computers design based on the whims of some author but it is a discovery produced by a long evolution and a deep
__label__computers deep tradition it has seen several revolutions transition from m expression to s expression from evalquote to eval or from dynamic
__label__computers dynamic binding to static binding introduction of data structures of object oriented programming and of a meta object protocol the invention
__label__computers invention and latter standardization of many many individual features many dialects of lisp also introduce their own revolutions such as continuations
__label__computers continuations and single name space in scheme the graphical user interface and dreaded dwim features in interlisp etc if anything remains
__label__computers remains among all these revolutions and variants it is the ability to evolve lisp is a language fit for evolution not
__label__computers not just by a small group of wizards who control the language implementation but by every single programmer who uses the
__label__computers the language and this wasn t a conscious intended part of the original design this was the great discovery of lisp
__label__computers lisp if this article made you want to start using lisp i can recommend the quick lisp guide to starting with
__label__computers with common lisp if you want to know why metaprogramming matters see my article metaprogramming and free availability of sources in
__label__computers in a next article i will write about how some other languages allow for evolution in different ways what they still
__label__computers still have to learn from the lisp tradition what the lisp tradition has to learn from them what makes it difficult
__label__computers difficult for either mainstream languages or lisp languages a a a list of three elements a list of no elements the
__label__computers the empty list nil a list of no elements the empty list a a list of one element the string a
__label__computers a a a list of two elements a and the empty list a nil equivalent to the previous a b c
__label__computers c a list of one element which is a list of three elements and then the aha moment happens i finally
__label__computers finally get lisp it s just a string representation of the abstract syntax tree for any language i could embed a
__label__computers a lisp interpreter in the query parser i could use lisp macros to perform optimizations on the query there s a
__label__computers a jjtree grammar for python in the jython package i could parse python into lisp programs i m onto a really
__label__computers really big concept possibly the next big thing the grand unification of all scripting languages now i have to move back
__label__computers back to xemacs from netbeans all i need to do is increase the output by and the city will be mine
__label__computers mine if only i had more power at mit lisp plays a foundational role in the curriculum for all programmers entrepreneurs
__label__computers entrepreneurs like paul graham used lisp s incredible productivity as the jet fuel for successful startups but to the chagrin of
__label__computers of its lispers lisp never made it into the mainstream as a java programmer if you spend some time with lisp
__label__computers lisp a notice that lisp capitalizes the a lisp assumes that you want to use a as a symbol because you
__label__computers you have not enclosed it in quotes i ll discuss assignments but i first need to cover lists to do so
__label__computers so a lisp list is simply a sequence of atoms enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces try to type a
__label__computers a list such as the one in listing it doesn t work unless you precede the list with a listing typing
__label__computers typing a simple list gt gt first rest rest gt cons cons nil gt cons cons cons nil gt cons first
__label__computers first these examples might not get you excited but the principle of building a clean and beautiful language on such simple
__label__computers simple primitives is intoxicating to some programmers these simple list building instructions form the foundation of recursions higher order functions and
__label__computers and even higher order abstractions like closures and continuations it s time to move up to higher abstractions back to top
__label__computers top building functions lisp function declarations are you guessed it lists listing which builds a function returning a list s second
__label__computers second element shows the form of function declarations listing building the second function defun my second lst first rest lst defun
__label__computers defun is the function that defines custom functions the first argument is the function name the second the argument list and
__label__computers and the third is the code you wish to execute you can see that all lisp code is expressed as lists
__label__computers lists this flexibility and power let you manipulate your application as well as you can manipulate any other data you ll
__label__computers ll later see some examples that blur the distinction between code and data lisp also handles conditional constructs such as the
__label__computers the if statement the form is if condition statement then statement else statement listing shows a simple my max function that

__label__computers f f y f or in data definitions i ve heard you can build a y combinator of sorts using the
__label__computers the latter but never actually tried it posted by emk am eric i m the same way about puzzles the y
__label__computers y combinator was a mildly interesting toy to me sort of like a rubik s cube or a crossword puzzle i
__label__computers i could play with it for a few minutes but it couldn t really hold my attention what really put me
__label__computers me over the top about learning it was when i started writing a parser combinator library if you write those combinator
__label__computers combinator as recursive functions then left recursion will make the parser loop and i found that really inelegant but if you
__label__computers you write a customized recursion combinator your recursive parser can check to ensure you re making progress through the stream and
__label__computers and abort if you start to loop writing such a combinator requires understanding how the y combinator works and that gave
__label__computers gave me the energy to really dig into it my learning methodology is to read very broadly but shallowly to get
__label__computers get a big store of ideas i ve heard about as contrasted with ideas i really understand then when i write
__label__computers write some code that seems inelegant to me i ll try and pattern match against the things i ve read about
__label__computers about and rummage for some applicable sounding ideas then i ll study them in depth to figure out how to write
__label__computers write something more general i think this is a less common style among hacker types who generally find intrinsic excitement in

__label__computers for programmer productivity and fun following the principles of good user interface design at a google tech talk in matsumoto further
__label__computers further stated i hope to see ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive and to enjoy programming and
__label__computers and to be happy that is the primary purpose of ruby language he stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human
__label__computers human rather than computer ruby is object oriented every value is an object including classes and instances of types that many
__label__computers many other languages designate as primitives such as integers booleans and null variables always hold references to objects every function is
__label__computers is a method and methods are always called on an object methods defined at the top level scope become members of

__label__economics in microeconomics production is the conversion of inputs into outputs it is an economic process that uses inputs to create a
__label__economics a commodity for exchange or direct use production is a flow and thus a rate of output per period of time
__label__economics time distinctions include such production alternatives as for consumption food haircuts etc vs investment goods new tractors buildings roads etc public
__label__economics public goods national defense small pox vaccinations etc or private goods new computers bananas etc and guns vs butter opportunity cost
__label__economics cost refers to the economic cost of production the value of the next best opportunity foregone choices must be made between
__label__economics between desirable yet mutually exclusive actions it has been described as expressing the basic relationship between scarcity and choice the opportunity
__label__economics opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently such that the cost is
__label__economics is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it opportunity costs are not restricted
__label__economics restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the real cost of output forgone leisure or anything else
__label__economics else that provides the alternative benefit utility inputs used in the production process include such primary factors of production as labour
__label__economics labour services capital durable produced goods used in production such as an existing factory and land including natural resources other inputs
__label__economics inputs may include intermediate goods used in production of final goods such as the steel in a new car economic efficiency
__label__economics efficiency describes how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available technology efficiency is improved
__label__economics improved if more output is generated without changing inputs or in other words the amount of waste is reduced a widely
__label__economics widely accepted general standard is pareto efficiency which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making
__label__economics making someone else worse off an example ppf with illustrative points marked the production possibility frontier ppf is an expository figure
__label__economics figure for representing scarcity cost and efficiency in the simplest case an economy can produce just two goods say guns and
__label__economics and butter the ppf is a table or graph as at the right showing the different quantity combinations of the two
__label__economics two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs which limit feasible total output each point on the curve
__label__economics curve shows potential total output for the economy which is the maximum feasible output of one good given a feasible output
__label__economics output quantity of the other good scarcity is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate
__label__economics aggregate to consume beyond the ppf such as at x and by the negative slope of the curve if production of
__label__economics of one good increases along the curve production of the other good decreases an inverse relationship this is because increasing output
__label__economics output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good decreasing the latter the slope of
__label__economics of the curve at a point on it gives the trade off between the two goods it measures what an additional
__label__economics additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good an example of a real opportunity cost thus
__label__economics thus if one more gun costs units of butter the opportunity cost of one gun is butter along the ppf scarcity
__label__economics scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good still in
__label__economics in a market economy movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be
__label__economics be worth the cost to the agents by construction each point on the curve shows productive efficiency in maximizing output for
__label__economics for given total inputs a point inside the curve as at a is feasible but represents production inefficiency wasteful use of
__label__economics of inputs in that output of one or both goods could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point
__label__economics point on the curve examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business cycle recession or economic organization of
__label__economics of a country that discourages full use of resources being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency also
__label__economics also called pareto efficiency if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points much applied
__label__economics applied economics in public policy is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved recognizing the reality
__label__economics reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described
__label__economics described as the essence of economics where the subject makes its unique contribution specialization main articles division of labour comparative advantage
__label__economics advantage and gains from trade specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and empirical considerations different individuals or
__label__economics or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production say from differences in stocks of human capital per worker or
__label__economics or capital labour ratios according to theory this may give a comparative advantage in production of goods that make more intensive
__label__economics intensive use of the relatively more abundant thus relatively cheaper input even if one region has an absolute advantage as to
__label__economics to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output it may still specialize in the output in
__label__economics in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but
__label__economics but has a comparative advantage in producing something else it has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among
__label__economics among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs including high income countries this has led
__label__economics led to investigation of economies of scale and agglomeration to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines to the overall
__label__economics overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions the general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals farms manufacturers service
__label__economics service providers and economies among each of these production systems there may be a corresponding division of labour with different work
__label__economics work groups specializing or correspondingly different types of capital equipment and differentiated land uses an example that combines features above is
__label__economics is a country that specializes in the production of high tech knowledge products as developed countries do and trades with developing
__label__economics developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful resulting in different in opportunity costs of
__label__economics of production more total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its
__label__economics its own high tech and low tech products theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs
__label__economics outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage so that relatively low cost inputs go to
__label__economics to producing low cost outputs in the process aggregate output may increase as a by product or by design such specialization
__label__economics specialization of production creates opportunities for gains from trade whereby resource owners benefit from trade in the sale of one type
__label__economics type of output for other more highly valued goods a measure of gains from trade is the increased income levels that
__label__economics that trade may facilitate supply and demand main article supply and demand a graph depicting quantity on the x axis and
__label__economics and price on the y axis the supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance
__label__economics balance between product availability and demand the graph depicts an increase that is right shift in demand from d to d
__label__economics d along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve
__label__economics curve s prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a
__label__economics a market economy the theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced
__label__economics produced and consumed in microeconomics it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition which includes the
__label__economics the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price setting power for a given market of a commodity
__label__economics commodity demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of
__label__economics of the good demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded as in the
__label__economics the figure demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good given income prices tastes
__label__economics tastes etc a term for this is constrained utility maximization with income and wealth as the constraints on demand here utility
__label__economics utility refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred the
__label__economics the law of demand states that in general price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related that is
__label__economics is the higher the price of a product the less of it people would be prepared to buy of it other
__label__economics other things unchanged as the price of a commodity falls consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods the substitution
__label__economics substitution effect in addition purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy the income effect other factors can change
__label__economics change demand for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the
__label__economics the origin as in the figure all determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply supply is the
__label__economics the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price it may be represented
__label__economics represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied producers for example business firms are hypothesized to be profit
__label__economics profit maximizers meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit
__label__economics profit supply is typically represented as a directly proportional relation between price and quantity supplied other things unchanged that is the
__label__economics the higher the price at which the good can be sold the more of it producers will supply as in the
__label__economics the figure the higher price makes it profitable to increase production just as on the demand side the position of the
__label__economics the supply can shift say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement the law
__label__economics law of supply states that in general a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in
__label__economics in price leads to a contraction in supply here as well the determinants of supply such as price of substitutes cost
__label__economics cost of production technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time
__label__economics time period of evaluation of supply market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded the intersection of the supply and
__label__economics and demand curves in the figure above at a price below equilibrium there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to
__label__economics to quantity demanded this is posited to bid the price up at a price above equilibrium there is a surplus of
__label__economics of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded this pushes the price down the model of supply and demand predicts that for
__label__economics for given supply and demand curves price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity
__label__economics quantity demanded similarly demand and supply theory predicts a new price quantity combination from a shift in demand as to the
__label__economics the figure or in supply for a given quantity of a consumer good the point on the demand curve indicates the
__label__economics the value or marginal utility to consumers for that unit it measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for
__label__economics for that unit the corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost the increase in total cost to the supplier
__label__economics supplier for the corresponding unit of the good the price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand in a perfectly
__label__economics perfectly competitive market supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium on the supply side of the market
__label__economics market some factors of production are described as relatively variable in the short run which affects the cost of changing output
__label__economics output levels their usage rates can be changed easily such as electrical power raw material inputs and over time and temp
__label__economics temp work other inputs are relatively fixed such as plant and equipment and key personnel in the long run all inputs
__label__economics inputs may be adjusted by management these distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity responsiveness of the supply curve in the
__label__economics the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand
__label__economics demand side of the market marginalist theory such as above describes the consumers as attempting to reach most preferred positions subject
__label__economics subject to income and wealth constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints including demand for goods
__label__economics goods produced technology and the price of inputs for the consumer that point comes where marginal utility of a good net
__label__economics net of price reaches zero leaving no net gain from further consumption increases analogously the producer compares marginal revenue identical to
__label__economics to price for the perfect competitor against the marginal cost of a good with marginal profit the difference at the point
__label__economics point where marginal profit reaches zero further increases in production of the good stop for movement to market equilibrium and for
__label__economics for changes in equilibrium price and quantity also change at the margin more or less of something rather than necessarily all
__label__economics all or nothing other applications of demand and supply include the distribution of income among the factors of production including labour
__label__economics labour and capital through factor markets in a competitive labour market for example the quantity of labour employed and the price
__label__economics price of labour the wage rate depends on the demand for labour from employers for production and supply of labour from
__label__economics from potential workers labour economics examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of
__label__economics of wages and other labour income labour mobility and un employment productivity through human capital and related public policy issues demand
__label__economics demand and supply analysis is used to explain the behavior of perfectly competitive markets but as a standard of comparison it
__label__economics it can be extended to any type of market it can also be generalized to explain variables across the economy for
__label__economics for example total output d as real gdp and the general price level as studied in macroeconomics tracing the qualitative and
__label__economics and quantitative effects of variables that change supply and demand whether in the short or long run is a standard exercise
__label__economics exercise in applied economics economic theory may also specify conditions such that supply and demand through the market is an efficient
__label__economics efficient mechanism for allocating resources firms main articles theory of the firm industrial organization business economics and managerial economics people frequently
__label__economics frequently do not trade directly on markets instead on the supply side they may work in and produce through firms the
__label__economics the most obvious kinds of firms are corporations partnerships and trusts according to ronald coase people begin to organise their production
__label__economics production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market firms combine labour and
__label__economics and capital and can achieve far greater economies of scale when the average cost per unit declines as more units are
__label__economics are produced than individual market trading in perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand there are many
__label__economics many producers none of which significantly influence price industrial organization generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behavior of
__label__economics of firms that do have significant control of price it considers the structure of such markets and their interactions common market
__label__economics market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition various forms of oligopoly and monopoly managerial economics applies microeconomic analysis to
__label__economics to specific decisions in business firms or other management units it draws heavily from quantitative methods such as operations research and
__label__economics and programming and from statistical methods such as regression analysis in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge a unifying theme
__label__economics theme is the attempt to optimize business decisions including unit cost minimization and profit maximization given the firm s objectives and
__label__economics and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions uncertainty and game theory main articles information economics game theory and financial economics
__label__economics economics uncertainty in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss whether quantifiable as risk or not without it household
__label__economics household behavior would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange of a
__label__economics a single instrument in each market period and there would be no communications industry given its different forms there are various
__label__economics various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents responses to it game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that
__label__economics that considers strategic interactions between agents one kind of uncertainty it provides a mathematical foundation of industrial organization discussed above to
__label__economics to model different types of firm behavior for example in an oligopolistic industry few sellers but equally applicable to wage negotiations
__label__economics negotiations bargaining contract design and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other as
__label__economics as a method heavily used in behavioral economics it postulates that agents choose strategies to maximize their payoffs given the strategies
__label__economics strategies of other agents with at least partially conflicting interests in this it generalizes maximization approaches developed to analyze market actors
__label__economics actors such as in the supply and demand model and allows for incomplete information of actors the field dates from the
__label__economics the classic theory of games and economic behavior by john von neumann and oskar morgenstern it has significant applications seemingly outside
__label__economics outside of economics in such diverse subjects as formulation of nuclear strategies ethics political science and evolutionary biology risk aversion may
__label__economics may stimulate activity that in well functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk as in markets for insurance
__label__economics insurance commodity futures contracts and financial instruments financial economics or simply finance describes the allocation of financial resources it also analyzes
__label__economics analyzes the pricing of financial instruments the financial structure of companies the efficiency and fragility of financial markets financial crises and
__label__economics and related government policy or regulation some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty based on george akerlof
__label__economics akerlof s market for lemons article the paradigm example is of a dodgy second hand car market customers without knowledge of
__label__economics of whether a car is a lemon depress its price below what a quality second hand car would be information asymmetry
__label__economics asymmetry arises here if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it related problems
__label__economics problems in insurance are adverse selection such that those at most risk are most likely to insure say reckless drivers and
__label__economics and moral hazard such that insurance results in riskier behavior say more reckless driving both problems may raise insurance costs and
__label__economics and reduce efficiency in driving otherwise willing transactors from the market incomplete markets moreover attempting to reduce one problem say adverse
__label__economics adverse selection by mandating insurance may add to another say moral hazard information economics which studies such problems has relevance in
__label__economics in subjects such as insurance contract law mechanism design monetary economics and health care applied subjects include market and legal remedies

__label__economics for quality and information disclosure market failure main articles market failure government failure information economics environmental economics and agricultural economics a
__label__economics a smokestack releasing smoke pollution can be a simple example of market failure if costs of production are not borne by
__label__economics by producers but are by the environment accident victims or others then prices are distorted the term market failure encompasses several
__label__economics several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions although economists categorise market failures differently the ing categories emerge in the main
__label__economics main texts information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market
__label__economics market legal and regulatory remedies as discussed above natural monopoly or the overlapping concepts of practical and technical monopoly is an
__label__economics an extreme case of failure of competition as a restraint on producers the problem is described as one where the more
__label__economics more of a product is made the lower the unit costs are this means it only makes economic sense to have
__label__economics have one producer public goods are goods which are undersupplied in a typical market the defining features are that people can
__label__economics can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at
__label__economics at the same time externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not
__label__economics not reflected in market prices for example air pollution may generate a negative externality and education may generate a positive externality
__label__economics externality less crime etc governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or
__label__economics or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price distortions caused by
__label__economics by these externalities elementary demand and supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due
__label__economics due to a shift in demand or supply in many areas some form of price stickiness is postulated to account for
__label__economics for quantities rather than prices adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side this
__label__economics this includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their
__label__economics their implications for reaching a hypothesized long run equilibrium examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in
__label__economics in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition macroeconomic instability addressed below is a prime source of
__label__economics of market failure whereby a general loss of business confidence or external shock can grind production and distribution to a halt
__label__economics halt undermining ordinary markets that are otherwise sound a woman samples of water from a river environmental scientist sampling water some
__label__economics some specialised fields of economics deal in market failure more than others the economics of the public sector is one example

__label__economics supply aggregate demand unemployment and great depression the economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of macroeconomics as
__label__economics as a separate discipline field of study during the great depression of the s john maynard keynes authored a book entitled
__label__economics entitled the general theory of employment interest and money outlining the key theories of keynesian economics keynes contended that aggregate demand
__label__economics demand for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output he therefore
__label__economics therefore advocated active policy responses by the public sector including monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions
__label__economics actions by the government to stabilize output over the business cycle thus a central conclusion of keynesian economics is that in
__label__economics in some situations no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards full employment levels john hicks is lm model has
__label__economics has been the most influential interpretation of the general theory over the years understanding of the business cycle has branched into
__label__economics into various research programs mostly related to or distinct from keynesianism the neoclassical synthesis refers to the reconciliation of keynesian economics
__label__economics economics with neoclassical economics stating that keynesianism is correct in the short run but qualified by neoclassical like considerations in the
__label__economics the intermediate and long run new classical macroeconomics as distinct from the keynesian view of the business cycle posits market clearing
__label__economics clearing with imperfect information it includes friedman s permanent income hypothesis on consumption and rational expectations theory lead by robert lucas
__label__economics lucas and real business cycle theory in contrast the new keynesian approach retains the rational expectations assumption however it assumes a
__label__economics a variety of market failures in particular new keynesians assume prices and wages are sticky which means they do not adjust
__label__economics adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions thus the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full
__label__economics full employment whereas the new keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run and hence government
__label__economics government and central bank policies are needed because the long run may be very long unemployment main article unemployment percent of
__label__economics of us population employed the amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate the percentage of workers
__label__economics workers without jobs in the labour force the labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs people who are retired
__label__economics retired pursuing education or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labor force unemployment
__label__economics unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes classical unemployment occurs when wages are
__label__economics are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers wages may be too high because of minimum wage
__label__economics wage laws or union activity consistent with classical unemployment frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker but
__label__economics but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment structural unemployment
__label__economics unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers skills and the skills required for open
__label__economics open jobs large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set
__label__economics set of skills are no longer in demand structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of
__label__economics of matching workers with job vacancies but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short
__label__economics short term search process while some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy cyclical unemployment occurs
__label__economics occurs when growth stagnates okun s law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth the original version of okun

__label__economics is a means of final payment for goods in most price system economies and the unit of account in which prices

__label__economics money does money has a general acceptability a relative consistency in value divisibility durability portability elastic in supply and survives with

__label__economics policy as the central bank of the united states as a medium of exchange money facilitates trade it is essentially a
__label__economics a measure of value and more importantly a store of value being a basis for credit creation its economic function can
__label__economics can be contrasted with barter non monetary exchange given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers barter may entail
__label__economics entail a hard to locate double coincidence of wants as to what is exchanged say apples and a book money can
__label__economics can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability then it is less costly for the seller to
__label__economics to accept money in exchange rather than what the buyer produces at the level of an economy theory and evidence are
__label__economics are consistent with a positive relationship running from the total money supply to the nominal value of total output and to
__label__economics to the general price level for this reason management of the money supply is a key aspect of monetary policy fiscal
__label__economics fiscal policy main articles fiscal policy and government spending governments implement fiscal policy by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter
__label__economics alter aggregate demand when aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy there is an output gap where some
__label__economics some productive capacity is left unemployed governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand resources that have been idled
__label__economics idled can be used by the government for example unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways tax cuts allow
__label__economics allow consumers to increase their spending which boosts aggregate demand both tax cuts and spending have multiplier effects where the initial
__label__economics initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity the effects of fiscal policy
__label__economics policy can be limited by crowding out when there is no output gap the economy is producing at full capacity and
__label__economics and there are no excess productive resources if the government increases spending in this situation the government use resources that otherwise
__label__economics otherwise would have been used by the private sector so there is no increase in overall output some economists think that
__label__economics that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed
__label__economics depressed skeptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of ricardian equivalence they argue that an increase in debt will have
__label__economics have to be paid for with future tax increases which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to
__label__economics to pay for the future tax increase under ricardian equivalence any boost in demand from fiscal policy will be offset by
__label__economics by the increased savings rate intended to pay for future higher taxes international economics main articles international economics and economic system

__label__economics economists draw on the tools of calculus linear algebra statistics game theory and computer science professional economists are expected to be
__label__economics be familiar with these tools while a minority specialize in econometrics and mathematical methods theory mainstream economic theory relies upon a
__label__economics a priori quantitative economic models which employ a variety of concepts theory typically proceeds with an assumption of ceteris paribus which
__label__economics which means holding constant explanatory variables other than the one under consideration when creating theories the objective is to find ones
__label__economics ones which are at least as simple in information requirements more precise in predictions and more fruitful in generating additional research
__label__economics research than prior theories in microeconomics principal concepts include supply and demand marginalism rational choice theory opportunity cost budget constraints utility
__label__economics utility and the theory of the firm early macroeconomic models focused on modeling the relationships between aggregate variables but as the
__label__economics the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists including new keynesians reformulated their models in microfoundations the aforementioned microeconomic concepts play
__label__economics play a major part in macroeconomic models for instance in monetary theory the quantity theory of money predicts that increases in
__label__economics in the money supply increase inflation and inflation is assumed to be influenced by rational expectations in development economics slower growth
__label__economics growth in developed nations has been sometimes predicted because of the declining marginal returns of investment and capital and this has

__label__economics can conceivably be refuted by empirical data empirical investigation main articles econometrics and experimental economics economic theories are frequently tested empirically
__label__economics empirically largely through the use of econometrics using economic data the controlled experiments common to the physical sciences are difficult and

__label__health changed my runners every miles come to think of it why do i see so many runners with lower extremity injuries
__label__health injuries in my office the traditional answer to these questions has always been overuse often compounded by an underlying mechanical abnormality
__label__health abnormality such as over pronation or flat feet the treatment along with modification of training physiotherapy stretching etc has always included
__label__health included a close look at the runner s footwear often with recommendations about motion control stability cushioning orthotics or custom molded
__label__health molded insoles a growing body of literature in the field of sports medicine however is causing a bit of a stir
__label__health stir no call it panic in the running world everything you and i always believed about running shoes and running injuries
__label__health injuries may be wrong here s the scoop the modern running shoe itself may be the major cause of running injuries
__label__health injuries stated another way the modern running shoe presently thought of a protective device should be reclassified as a health hazard
__label__health hazard nike please tell me it ain t so now relax get back on your chair and take a deep breath
__label__health breath we ll take this one step at a time and since we re going to be talking about shoes and
__label__health and feet i may as well start at the beginning the very beginning until quite recently in our history most humans
__label__health humans lived out their lives unshod s f stewart in his footgear it s history uses and abuses states that all
__label__health all writers who have reported their observations of barefoot peoples agree that the untrammeled feet of natural men are free from
__label__health from the disabilities commonly noted among shod people hallux valgus bunions hammer toe and painful feet so why was footgear developed
__label__health developed one of the earliest examples of footgear known to us the form of sagebrush bark sandals found in caves and
__label__health and rock shelters near fort rock oregon under a layer of volcanic ash dating back years the foot surface is smooth
__label__health smooth and they were held on by bast straps over the instep similar sandals were used throughout the volcanic cordilleras of
__label__health of meso and south america and the volcanic islands of the south pacific the early polynesians used sandals to cross old
__label__health old lava flows and when fishing on the razor sharp coral it seems therefore that the prime function of the earliest
__label__health earliest sandals was protection of the sole although the early pharaohs are all represented as barefoot by the first millennium bc
__label__health bc sandals in egypt were common in court and were worn by soldiers in mesopotamian kingdoms sandals were evidently a status
__label__health status symbol with the king known to have worn a wedged sandal in contrast to his flat soled courtiers very thick
__label__health thick soled low boots are known to have been worn by greek tragedians to increase their height comedians wore socks or
__label__health or soccus hence the expression high tragedy and low comedy thus the secondary function of footgear appears to have been symbolic
__label__health symbolic from the time of the greeks footgear gradually evolved to meet both symbolic and functional needs for example tradition tells
__label__health tells us that about the beginning of the present millennium count fulk of anjou introduced long pointed toes to cover up
__label__health up some deformity of his feet and courtiers quickly adopted the fashion the mongols who on horseback ravaged the middle east
__label__health east between damascus and moscow from the th th centuries are credited for the introduction of the block heel presumably developed
__label__health developed to better grip the stirrup plate but in the french court of louis xiv the rugged mongolian heel underwent a
__label__health a radical cosmetic transformation eventually leading to the ultimate idiotic expression of modern fashion the stiletto heel european peasants wore clogs
__label__health clogs carved from a block of wood mass production seems to have begun prior to the th century for edward ii
__label__health ii in decreed that shoes should be sized their length was measured in barleycorns to an inch this is still the
__label__health the basis of shoe measurements inch to a size in length we start sizing from a baseline of in children and
__label__health and in adults widths vary with length in a given size the widths vary by inch unpaired shoes were introduced in
__label__health in england in the th century when gout became common and these shoes had broad square toes to relieve pressure the
__label__health the most recent innovation seems to have been the hard box toe to preserve the appearance of the shoe now let
__label__health let s focus in on the running shoe it seems that the earliest sports shoes were developed in the s by
__label__health by the liverpool rubber company owned by john boyd dunlop although they were first called sand shoes because they were worn
__label__health worn on the beach by the victorian middle classes they eventually became known as plimsolls because the lines formed by the
__label__health the rubber and canvas bond looked similar to the plimsoll line on a ship s hull in dunlop launched its green
__label__health green flash range of trainers adi dassler and his brother rudolf started making sports shoes in herzogenaurach germany in and in
__label__health in jesse owens wore a pair of them when he won four olympic gold medals in berlin adidas adi dassler was
__label__health was formed in with the now famous three stripes logo developing from three support leather bands used to bolster the sides
__label__health sides by the olympics dozens of competitors were wearing adidas shoes rudolf dassler broke away to form puma amidst the first
__label__health first rumblings of the jogging boom nike after the greek goddess of victory was launched by american phil knight a former
__label__health former track star at the university of oregon and his waffle making coach bill bowerman in surely you remember the nike
__label__health nike waffle trainer the nike swoosh is arguably the most successful logo in the world and was conceived for phil knight
__label__health knight by a local oregon graphic design student carolyn davidson for a total fee of but don t worry about the
__label__health the graphic designer in september nike presented carolyn davidson with a rather substantial share package as a way of saying thank
__label__health thank you asics acronym for animus sanus in corpore sano latin for a sound mind in a sound body first introduced
__label__health introduced its shoes in north america in while reebock named after a species of an african gazelle entered the us market
__label__health market in as the running shoe was slowly transforming into a fashion item was declared the year of the running shoe
__label__health shoe by the clothing industry the same year nike launched the cross trainer and it s flagship running shoe the air
__label__health air max after years of research nike introduced its shox line of runners in arguably the first athletic shoe on springs
__label__health springs foam part shoes and injuries for the last fifteen years or so buying a pair of runners has always been
__label__health been accompanied by a warm fuzzy feeling inside a feeling that comes from the certain knowledge that you re investing in
__label__health in a high tech device purpose designed to protect you from injury and improve your performance you can just see all
__label__health all those smart dedicated nike mechanical engineers hard at work developing and testing newer and better space age materials to shield
__label__health shield you from the terrible pounding you submit yourself to in order to just do it gel air channels honeycomb microspheres
__label__health microspheres super light materials foam springs and soon yes you guessed it micro chips in the soles of your shoes better
__label__health better than diamonds i suppose new round laces and ribbon eyelets result in that custom fitted feel supplemented by molded sorbothane
__label__health sorbothane insoles or special orthotics from your local prosthetist and you re ready to tackle any distance now here s the
__label__health the catch if all this high tech stuff is supposed to be preventing running injuries by shielding us from impact why
__label__health why is it that two out of every three runners are sidelined every year because of a running injury why is
__label__health is it that since the great jogging boom of the mid seventies there has been no decrease in the incidence some
__label__health some authors say there has been an increase of running injures in spite of yearly improvements in running shoe technology why
__label__health why is my office filled with runners who have injured knees of running injuries tibias achilles tendons and plantar fascias the
__label__health the cause of all these injuries is quite evident cumulative micro trauma caused by repetitive impact experienced during running the heel
__label__health heel of a runner upon striking the ground generates a force that can equal times body weight at the foot and
__label__health and as much as times body weight at the hip repeat this times per mile and it s easy to appreciate
__label__health appreciate the stress the old bones are under add to this the hardness of urban roadways compared to naturally deposited surfaces
__label__health surfaces and eventually something gives inflammation sets in and pain results and you end up working at the finish line pulling
__label__health pulling bar codes off finishers now where s our high tech shoe in all this with all the improvements in recent
__label__health recent years you d think we d be seeing a marked decrease in running injuries just keep reading it wasn t
__label__health t till the mid eighties that some researchers smelled something rotten in the athletic footwear world and it wasn t just
__label__health just dirty socks footwear manufacturers were well aware that impact was the cause of running injuries and reasoned that the way
__label__health way to attenuate impact was to interpose a soft impact absorbing midsole between the foot and the ground the first major
__label__health major problem was the method used by essentially all the footwear development labs to test the impact absorption of footwear mid
__label__health mid soles dr benno nigg from the university of calgary showed that machine testing of these materials by dropping a kg
__label__health kg object onto the shoe sole and measuring the impact on a pressure plate did not accurately predict human impact with
__label__health with the same materials in fact the correlation turned out to be inverse that is when you drop a kg ball
__label__health ball on materials of increasing softness you measure decreasing impact however when the impact from a running human is measured the
__label__health the result is the reverse and the impact increases with softer materials whoops you ll find out why later next problem
__label__health problem in dr b marti published a paper which still makes the throats of footwear executives go dry he studied runners
__label__health runners who participated in a km race and had them fill out an extensive questionnaire about their running in the year
__label__health year preceding the race here s what he found the incidence of injuries in runners using shoes costing more than was
__label__health was more that twice as great as in runners using shoes costing less than note that this result includes correction for
__label__health for other influencing factors such as training mileage and history of previous injury in other words the fancier high tech advanced
__label__health advanced the shoe the more dangerous it is now a study of over runners is not something to thumb your nose
__label__health nose at and you would think the shoe manufacturers would have taken some notice not on your life yearly athletic shoe
__label__health shoe sales were in the billions of dollars and this was no time to fiddle with a successful product in any
__label__health any case it is felt by many observers that by the mid eighties researchers in house or independent had effectively been
__label__health been forced out of the loop of new product development and that research and development was now exclusively in the hands
__label__health hands of the marketing people athletic shoes had become a fashion item and were designed as such as they are to
__label__health to this day the big question why are super shock absorbing athletic shoes causing more running injuries dr steven robbins from
__label__health from the centre for studies in aging at mcgill university in montreal is the man who came up with the answer
__label__health answer dr robbins pointed out that the human lower extremity is not a delicate rigid passive structure requiring packaging to protect
__label__health protect it from impact this becomes blatantly obvious when one observes the nearly complete absence of foot disorders in unshod populations
__label__health populations people who go around barefoot just don t get plantar fasciitis or any of the other lower extremity injuries so
__label__health so common in shod populations the lower extremity he points out is a rugged flexible active well designed teleologically structure wire
__label__health wire this structure to a spinal cord and a brain and what you ve got is a system fully capable of
__label__health of handling the impacts of running so how does this system work exactly and why do modern running shoes screw it
__label__health it up allow me for a moment to compare the human locomotor apparatus to a modern luxury car the bones of
__label__health of the foot leg thigh and pelvis act as the frame linked by joints and all held together by fairly inelastic
__label__health inelastic ligaments and fascia the bones and joints are surrounded by contracting muscles which act as the suspension system this is
__label__health is especially evident in the arch of the foot which is formed by both the passive rigid plantar fascia as well
__label__health well as the active flexible intrinsic muscles the bones and muscles are covered by fat and skin within which reside receptors
__label__health receptors or sensors that send information to both the peripheral computer the spinal cord and the central computer the brain the
__label__health the skin on the sole of the foot glabrous skin is very well suited to its function possessing about of the
__label__health the toughness of hairy skin the skin everywhere else on our bodies except our palms the receptors in the foot are
__label__health are specially designed to sense both impact vertical force and shear horizontal force add to this information streaming in from pain
__label__health pain receptors as well as joint position receptors throughout the lower extremity and you ve got a hummer got carried away
__label__health away a little sorry during barefoot running the ball of the foot strikes the ground first and immediately starts sending signals
__label__health signals to the spinal cord and brain about the magnitude of impact and shear getting most of its clues about this
__label__health this from the skin contact with the surface irregularities of the ground take away this contact by adding a cushioned substance
__label__health substance and you immediately fool the system into underestimating the impact add a raised heel and the shod runner is forced
__label__health forced to land on it strap the cushioning on tightly with the aid of a sophisticated lacing system and you block
__label__health block out shear as well throwing the shock absorption system even further into the dark the system responds by landing harder
__label__health harder in an attempt to compress the cushion and feel the ground the weight is then transferred to the outside edge
__label__health edge of the foot completely by passing the skin of the arch the heel then touches down and the weight is
__label__health is transferred to the ball again with final push off through the toes while the weight is being transferred the arch
__label__health arch carries out its function as the suspension system of the foot and flattens under the active control of the intrinsic
__label__health intrinsic muscles the ankle knee and hip joints flex to absorb impact in response to information flowing in from the foot
__label__health foot the cushioned midsole of the modern running shoe robs the system of important sensory information necessary for ankle knee and
__label__health and hip response to impact the arch support or orthotic in modern running shoes not only prevents the arch suspension system
__label__health system from absorbing energy by preventing flattening but eventually leads to intrinsic muscle atrophy and complete loss of active muscular control
__label__health control of the arch leaving only the inelastic plantar fascia as a checkrein to flattening the barefoot runner s foot position
__label__health position awareness sense which relies heavily on sensory input from the sole of the foot minimizes his risk of sustaining an
__label__health an ankle sprain on uneven ground the shod runner is at marked increased risk of ankle sprains because his foot position
__label__health position awareness sense is handicapped by the paucity of sensations coming from his soles the barefoot runner is constantly alert scanning
__label__health scanning the ground before him for irregularities and dangers that might cause him injury the barefoot runner is a cautious runner
__label__health runner and actively changes his landing strategy to prevent injury he treads lightly the shod runner is bombarded by convincing advertising
__label__health advertising stating or implying that the shoe he is wearing will protect him well over any terrain and he becomes a
__label__health a careless runner he is heavy footed finally certain diseases in humans can cause a gradual destruction of the sensory nerve
__label__health nerve endings in the foot and elsewhere resulting in a significant increase in lower extremity injuries diabetes and tertiary syphilis are
__label__health are two extremities so affected are termed neuropathic the shod runner because of his sensory deprivation and high risk of injury
__label__health injury may be termed as having pseudo neuropathic feet a term coined by robbins the conclusion that shoes are the primary
__label__health primary cause of running injuries is strongly supported by the scientific literature i ve already mentioned marti s work showing more
__label__health more than twice the incidence of running injuries with expensive shoes compared with cheap ones rao and joseph examined indian children
__label__health children between the ages of and and found that the incidence of flat feet was more than three times greater in
__label__health in those children who used footwear than in those who did not leading them to conclude that shoe wearing in early
__label__health early childhood is detrimental to the development of a normal arch in hamill and bates showed that as running shoes lose
__label__health lose their cushioning through wear and tear subjects improve foot control on testing and presumably decrease their risk of injury i
__label__health i e shoes get better with age robbins and gouw showed in that modern athletic footwear creates a perceptual illusion in
__label__health in subjects whereby they consistently impact simply adding surface irregularities on the insoles to simulate barefoot like conditions markedly improves subjects
__label__health subjects s of impact robbins and others studied the balance ability of men walking along a beam wearing shoes with soles
__label__health soles of varying thickness and hardness results confirmed that the thinner and harder the soles the better the balance in one
__label__health one of their most elegant and widely publicized studies robbins and waked examined the effect of advertising on landing impact they
__label__health they asked subjects to step down barefoot ten times onto four pressure measuring platforms the first one being bare and the
__label__health the other three covered by identical shoe sole material made to look different by different colored cloth the subjects were given
__label__health given different messages for each of the covered plates the message for the first covered plate suggested superior impact absorption and
__label__health and protection deceptive message the second suggested poor impact absorption and high injury risk warning message and the third suggested unknown
__label__health unknown impact absorption and safety neutral message results showed that subjects landed with the highest impact when given the deceptive and
__label__health and neutral messages and with the lowest impact when given the warning message or with the bare plate the authors conclude
__label__health conclude that running injury rates are greatest in users of the most expensive shoes because advertising has deceived these users into
__label__health into believing that the shoes provide a superior level of safety thereby inducing an attenuation of impact moderating behavior increasing impact
__label__health impact and injury the authors add that deceptive advertising of protective devices is a public health hazard and should be addressed
__label__health addressed humans are less cautious even when they use truthfully advertised products because of excessively positive attitudes toward new products and
__label__health and wrong impressions of the standards of truth in advertising so you think is this guy telling me that nike reebock
__label__health reebock and all those big corporations just put this new stuff out on the market without any proof that its safe
__label__health safe can t be well that s exactly what i m telling you i can be a real pain in the
__label__health the ass when i try and some years back i was in the mood i got on the phone and tried
__label__health tried to talk to the directors of research at all the big athletic footwear companies i tell you getting to talk
__label__health talk to one of these guys is harder than talking to the pope i finally got to speak with mr gordon
__label__health gordon valiant then director of research at the nike sports research lab in beaverton oregon jf mr valiant my name is
__label__health is dr froncioni and i m an orthopedic surgeon i treat a lot of runners and i was just wondering what
__label__health what your thoughts were on the whole issue of running injuries possibly being caused by your running shoes long pause gv
__label__health gv umm well i m afraid i m not at liberty to discuss that matter say what jf mr valiant in
__label__health in case you missed it i m not a reporter i m just an orthopedic surgeon who s looking for some
__label__health some answers for his patients let me rephrase surely you have data to support the injury protection claims you make about
__label__health about your running shoes surely sir gv well i could refer you to our marketing people and i m sure they
__label__health they could send you something nope we re not on the same wavelength at all i m sure the lawyers have
__label__health have given these guys a gag order jf mr valiant your marketing people send me stuff all the time it s
__label__health s all over the runner s world i get every anyway nice talking to you i ve also had a few
__label__health few chats with dr steven robbins he feels very strongly that the athletic footwear manufacturers are painting themselves into a very
__label__health very tight corner by not acting on the available information after all it is within their power to effect changes in
__label__health in their shoe design based on the available data and in doing so decreasing the running injury rate by up to
__label__health to by not acting now dr robbins predicts the footwear manufacturers may end up in the same situation as the tobacco
__label__health tobacco companies with massive class action lawsuits brought against them part new directions so what do we do now for starters
__label__health starters no i do not recommend that you run your next half marathon barefoot but certainly i predict that sooner or
__label__health or later changes will come about in both shoe design and training from the medical establishment s point of view the
__label__health the prevention and treatment of running injuries must change to incorporate the concepts outlined above in fact i view the ideas
__label__health ideas i ve presented here as a major paradigm shift in sports medicine the likes of which i have not seen
__label__health seen in the last fifteen years of course the major shoe companies have to own up and start introducing better shoes
__label__health shoes into their lines why not do this gradually and introduce just one shoe that incorporates some of the recommended changes
__label__health changes dr robbins is already testing shoes that use a thinner less resilient midsole material that provides the comfort but not
__label__health not the impact absorption and of course has no arch support i m sure the marketing boys at nike could handle
__label__health handle it without being too radical there are some changes that are worth introducing without further delay and they are as
__label__health as s young children should be encouraged to spend as much time as possible barefoot we know that this is especially
__label__health especially important for the proper formation of the foot arch in the first six years of life so moms trash the
__label__health the weebocks and let your kids develop strong healthy feet just as they were meant to runners should consider incorporating sessions
__label__health sessions of barefoot running into their training in an article in the october runner s world adam bean gives the ing
__label__health ing advice running barefoot a couple of times per week can decrease your risk of injury and boost your push off
__label__health off power you can run on any surface you like as long as you re careful of sharp objects and pebbles
__label__health pebbles soft sand is probably the least desirable surface because it is unstable and after your heel has dug in you
__label__health you will weight bear on your arch paved roads are fine and dangerous objects are easy to spot but remember your
__label__health your feet will need to toughen up so start with small doses kick your shoes off as soon as you get
__label__health get home and spend your evenings and weekends barefoot is it possible to rehabilitate the weakened muscles of a normally shod
__label__health shod runner it certainly is according to another excellent study by dr robbins he asked normally shod recreational runners to gradually
__label__health gradually increase barefoot activity both at home and outdoors over a period of several weeks and to maintain barefoot activity for
__label__health for about four s the runners feet were examined measured and x rayed at regular intervals to detect changes results showed
__label__health showed marked improvement in the anatomy and function of the arch the authors concluded that the normally shod foot is capable
__label__health capable of rehabilitation of foot musculature very good news indeed for all of us runners may want to consider switching to
__label__health to a lightweight shoe that provides less cushioning and no arch support the only shoes on the market that come close
__label__health close to these characteristics are racing flats i use the oz asics gel magic racer for you diehard nike fans consider
__label__health consider the air streak ii air streak spectrum plus or the air streak vapor iv but most shoe manufactures make a
__label__health a flat a shoe that nike has just introduced this year the nike free also looks like a step in the
__label__health the right direction i have not actually seen this shoe myself yet moreover a look at the nike free web page
__label__health page give me a bit of hope that this company may finally have seen the light if you do change to
__label__health to flats i recommend you wean into them slowly remember that you live in a developed country and that your feet
__label__health feet have been shielded from natural stresses your entire life i e you ve got wimpy feet buddy the intrinsic muscles
__label__health muscles of your feet are asleep and need to wake up slowly the first thing that will strike you in a
__label__health a racing flat is the lightness of the shoe most runners today run in shoes that weigh as much as oz
__label__health oz then you will quickly realize that for the first time you start to feel the ground you are walking on
__label__health on oh and one more thing don t listen to the guy at the running store he s there to sell
__label__health sell shoes and is under the spell of the powerful shoe industry advertising machine he has become well and truly brainwashed
__label__health brainwashed with the traditional concepts that we all need cushioning and arch support he will try to dissuade you from buying
__label__health buying a racing flat and he may even go as far as telling you that they are for elite runners and
__label__health and are meant to be used for one marathon only don t believe him i keep my flats for at least
__label__health least miles with no problem finally some radicals among you may wish to become full time barefoot runners barefoot running clubs
__label__health clubs are springing up all over america and europe point your search engine to barefoot running shoes and stress fracture s
__label__health s of the foot and or ankle karen mentioned her experience of such a fracture at http crazykmw blogspot com slug
__label__health slug no more html what s your opinion as to the role of the treadmill and or has anyone experienced a
__label__health a similar fracture whilst wearing a particular shoe design warm thanks edbiew posted by edbiew february at pm i really enjoyed
__label__health enjoyed reading the article i solved all my problems related to running injuries by learning the pose method of running by
__label__health by dr romanov the shoes that he reccomends is minimalist like the puma high street or the fivefingers posted by fred
__label__health fred february at am amazing article i read it twice and passed it on posted by joe february at am loved
__label__health loved the post on running shoes i m a middle aged woman my activity level varies from sedentary to low level
__label__health level activity i golf regularly and walk once in awhile i m also a bit overweight so often found myself with
__label__health with an achy and tired lower back after a half hour or so until i found mbts http www swissmasai com
__label__health com apparently these shoes were derived from the barefoot gait of the masai tribe i have pair and wear them as
__label__health as often as i can my back actually feels stronger and i no longer get the achiness and fatigue anyway check
__label__health check them out thanks again posted by julie a february at pm in general besides a couple of details the general
__label__health general story is pretty sound however i would not suggest people run barefoot on hard man made surfaces pavements etc you
__label__health you will damage yourself if you train extensively like this a nice viewpoint is to apply logical thinking and think how
__label__health how humans evolved we evolved running on soft sand and hard surfaces dried compacted mud so you can run on the
__label__health the pavement i hear you say well no even though you might not feel it there is a lot of cushioning
__label__health cushioning even on a dry mud surface when compared to concrete pavement these fancy cushion style running shoes started life by
__label__health by trying to reintroduce some of this cushioning but as usual man has taken it to the n th degree such
__label__health such that it is now detrimental as the article points out the details a couple of the facts in your story
__label__health story have been miss interpreted but as i said in general the message is pretty good so don t take this
__label__health this the wrong way for instance the argument about people in third world countries not having problems and not wearing footwear
__label__health footwear is a bit of a leap of faith you are assuming a correlation between two factors in a massively complex
__label__health complex and multi factorial system there are many other possible explanations eg their cultures are such that they are less likely
__label__health likely to admit pain and or are more likely to put up with pain than have a major operation this final
__label__health final point in also evident in japan where rates of joint replacement in patients under are extremely low when compared to
__label__health to european and the us when you ask the patients surgeons why the answer is purely because they do not think
__label__health think it a good idea in european and the us we have become so demanding we expect to live longer and
__label__health and to be able to do the same things if something breaks then it must be fixed this is crazy culture
__label__health culture and evident in the way we must sue someone for any action possible if trip in the street we sue
__label__health sue the government for make a poor foot path etc etc a general rant as for the marketing machine i agree
__label__health agree totally and utterly but that s life if you see anything just in our western world i d be amazed
__label__health amazed from cosmetics to cars to health care products they are all using the freud s psychology to make sure we
__label__health we buy buy buy on a functional basis there are v few things that we need but the world economy would
__label__health would stop if we didn t buy a new car every three years get that new phone drink that health shake
__label__health shake little to say what our neighbours would think unfortunately we have chosen the wrong social model and it s going
__label__health going to take a long time for us to bounce back in the right direction pants i hear you say well
__label__health well yes for most people but just use your brain as the author of this article has done don t believe
__label__health believe everything you hear and most of all come to your own conclusions ps i m not saying become a hippy
__label__health hippy heaven forbid just educate yourself read about social science body language etc etc and it becomes pretty obvious that we
__label__health we can rectify some of these issues on a personal level at least then is a couple of generations we ll
__label__health ll be back on track d posted by peteopia february at pm as a member of the pose method community and
__label__health and occasional barefooter it was wonderful to read this article because of the frigid temps out here on the east coast
__label__health coast i have been running in the new balance rc racing flat yeah training and racing in them can t wait
__label__health wait for the warmer weather so i can kick off the shoes a few times a week posted by john february
__label__health february at pm i would also like to ask about the rigid orthopedic arch supports you put them in your shoes
__label__health shoes like the dr scholl s implants i was given them because my arch supposedly does not support itself but i
__label__health i never wore them because they were too uncomfortable blisters etc i m not sure what this means in respect to
__label__health to the information presented can anyone shed some light on this so do you minimalist shoe wearers wear socks too if
__label__health if so what kind i m also curious what kind of shoes do the olympics sprinters use since i ve never
__label__health never come in contact with this information before i m not sure where else i would ask these questions thanks posted
__label__health posted by where to learn more february at pm i had to quit running due to permanent nerve damage in my
__label__health my left foot now i mostly wear dress shoes with no cushioning and little arch support and i ve noticed an
__label__health an improvement i also recommend going barefoot as much as possible posted by milt february at am great article i ve
__label__health ve been thinking along the same lines for the last couple of years years ago i switched to really minimalistic shoes
__label__health shoes puma h streets and learned how to run in those after years of constantly recurring achilles injuries i haven t
__label__health t had an injury since despite the fact that i ve been training both longer and more intensive than before posted
__label__health posted by lars nielsen february at am i ve had similar ideas about shoes for a long time i ve always
__label__health always been a fan of light flat and hard shoes like converse all stars and used them for everything i even
__label__health even wore them when i skateboarded for six years and i must say that my feet never hurt from being pounded
__label__health pounded on all day and i could feel the board much better than the when i wore proper skateboarding shoes for
__label__health for a brief period i no longer skateboard but still enjoy minimal shoes and currently wear chucks and kung fu shoes
__label__health shoes available at any martial arts store at a pair you really can t beat the kung fu shoe posted by
__label__health by duncan domingue february at am hello i have been running barefoot and with minimal shoes for about s the web
__label__health web address that the author mentioned at the article is a great resource for learning more about barefoot running the faq
__label__health faq page has almost every conceivable question you could think of about barefoot running here is the direct link http www
__label__health www runningbarefoot org name faq also as for shoe recommendations i sometimes use a very minimal shoe called vibram fivefingers http
__label__health http www vibramfivefingers com these are seriously amazing shoes very thin and lightweight i highly recommend them for running actually much
__label__health much more than the nike free i bought the nike free and it s a step in the right direction for
__label__health for nike but it still has quite a heel compared to something like the vibram fivefingers in other words you will
__label__health will still have issues with you feet sensing the ground in the nike frees for times when you are not running

__label__health those of us who have chosen a barefoot lifestyle the information has been available for years it s just been ignored
__label__health ignored by most the experts in the sports medicine industry i applaud you publishing this and encourage you to spread the
__label__health the word about how harmful shoes are the only time that one should wear shoes is when they re needed for
__label__health for protection against dangerous ground and i don t include your average city street in this even dirty cities like new
__label__health new york san francisco or oakland all of which i have walked barefoot in posted by zach february at am maybe
__label__health maybe i am overstimating the impact but have there been any comparative studies of running induced injuries in those raised in
__label__health in currently living in asian homes no shoes when inside usually and those raised in western homes shoes inside more often
__label__health often than not or studies from which such a comparison could be inferred conclusive evidence might be hard to come by
__label__health by but a comparison between injury rates of japanese and american runners probably as close a socioeconomic match as you re
__label__health re likely to find for this purpose would give some indication of how much prophylactic effect you can get just from
__label__health from going shoeless in the house posted by great article february at am hey dad i love it xx posted by

__label__health the past mins reading this article can you please recommend a normal day to day shoe posted by jason february at
__label__health at pm i have a question though what about pronation i experience a little shin pain depending on the shoes is
__label__health is there a flat shoe that helps with that or is the whole pronation ankle thing caused by cushioned shoes thanks
__label__health thanks posted by mike smick february at pm dr froncioni fantastic article regarding footwear and running injuries the puma h street
__label__health street is also a great shoe at about oz that lasts forever well for a really long time anyway i probably
__label__health probably have miles on one pair and on another with many years left on both also at least miles on my
__label__health my barefeet in the past years again great article thank you posted by shawn february at pm dr what you have
__label__health have here is landmark material this is the first time i have read someone in the medical community take a position
__label__health position so firmly against status quo that we need the protection of better shoes and orthotics and so eloquently suggested we
__label__health we get healthy by taking a more minimalist approach to running shoes i applaud you can you please contact me i
__label__health i would very much like to discuss this some more with you thank you mark posted by mark february at pm
__label__health pm this is an interesting article and poses a very serious issue however i think there is an issue that is
__label__health is just as serious adults do not know how to run after years of stress and sitting at a desk all
__label__health all day long they forgot how to run if you look at children running their form is much different than adults
__label__health adults the reason is they run naturally adults have forgotten how to do this and run unnaturally if you make your
__label__health your body do something for a long period of time in a way that is not natural for it then you
__label__health you will cause problems so there seems to be problems at stake here people don t run correctly people think shoes
__label__health shoes will compensate for all of this if you want to know what i am talking about when it comes to
__label__health to running correctly check out chi running yeah it sounds a little hokie but it makes a lot of sense if
__label__health if you have done it posted by peter february at pm awesome article doc well and informative i never would have
__label__health have guessed that cushioning impact made things worse but it makes perfect sense when you consider it removes the feedback loop
__label__health loop the body needs to function and protect itself under continued high impact load stress associated with running and the like
__label__health like thanks posted by specul february at pm eye opening article thanks any evidence that shoe design running or otherwise has
__label__health has anything to do with the incidence of gout i ve worn merrill shoes of various makes exclusively for three years
__label__health years and was recently diagnosed with the ailment posted by jim february at pm i ve had flat feet fallen arches
__label__health arches my entire life wearing hard plastic orthotic arch supports in high school helped tremendously i went from having almost insufferable
__label__health insufferable hip pain to being able to run normally very quickly on to my actual question can you wear these rigid
__label__health rigid orthotic arch supports in racing flats posted by drosser february at pm i recently purchase a pair of nike free
__label__health free shoes i jog on the beach when wearing them as i am a larger fellow and don t want to
__label__health to run right away on the road systems they seem to give plenty of whatever it is when i am jogging
__label__health jogging as i don t have that banging heaviness i did the one day i went jogging in my old house
__label__health house sneakers they work nicely so far you might want to research the history of hte nike free they were created
__label__health created as a result of a basketball coach in alabama or louisiana who had a statistically low amount of injuries to
__label__health to his players over the long term it was found his players ran in the grass barefoot thus the nike free
__label__health free the lesser the shoe was involved the healthier the person long term posted by john february at pm i think
__label__health think it is suggestive that soccer players who on average will run miles during the course of a minute game play
__label__health play in cleats that are flat thin and have no mid soles and no arch support ive never heard of a
__label__health a soccer player getting a runners injury despite the fact that they run nearly as much as runners do posted by
__label__health by nelziq february at pm some years ago i bought a pair of very well cushioned addidas cross trainers they made
__label__health made any walking running activity feel like my feet were on little clouds however after a few s i found that
__label__health that my gait had deteriorated to the point that if i was not wearing these shoes i would experience serious shock
__label__health shock loads up skeletal structure of my feet and legs i have since consigned these shoes to the back of a
__label__health a cupboard and now i use plimsole style shoes i e converse all stars i also enjoy the tactile response i
__label__health i have once these thinner soled shoes are worn in hospital best muscle rub ever sports akileine start cream is the
__label__health the best muscle rub i ve ever tried even better than my beloved tiger balm which i adore so deeply that
__label__health that i have often considered brushing my teeth with it i first tried this stuff after really wrenching my neck while
__label__health while on s in france the pharmacist at the local shop recommended it and it saved the trip instead of lying
__label__health lying down with an icepack all week i was running around having fun minutes after applying it i felt a deep
__label__health deep deep warmth in my muscles and one by one they loosened themselves relaxing away from the punishing spasm i ve
__label__health ve gone through two or three tubes since and i just polished off my last one after hurting my back while
__label__health while doing something foolish occupational hazard after two days this week on airplanes it s no wonder that my back is
__label__health is rebelling ten minutes ago i wanted to lie down and die now my back is a warm comfortable thing a
__label__health a little googling turned up an american distributor for the cream they mark it up percent but i still ordered another
__label__health another tube this stuff is worth its weight in gold link update here are some cheaper places to shop for the
__label__health the magic sauce courtesy of michael and matthew link link update yang adds and if you re in canada the sports
__label__health sports alkileine cream is available from mountain equipment co op also without ridiculous mark ups posted by cory doctorow at hangperson
__label__health hangperson s noose is unmistakably around the tobacco industry s neck in florida and mississippi state governments are attempting to force
__label__health force tobacco companies to pay some smoking related health care costs in washington d c the environmental protection agency has claimed
__label__health claimed that secondhand smoke is a significant risk for nonsmokers and the food drug administration is making noises about regulating nicotine
__label__health nicotine as a drug and recently the american medical association agreed reasserting that nicotine is addictive smokers have already been driven
__label__health driven away from many workplaces into the street for a furtive puff but further legal harassment to the point of what
__label__health what an industry spokesman calls backdoor prohibition seems unstoppable lost in this lynching frenzy the fact that smoking might be in
__label__health in some small ways good for you hold on now let s be clear the surgeon general has indeed determined that
__label__health that smoking is dangerous to your health lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases are highly correlated with cigarette consumption annual smoking related
__label__health related deaths are commonly said to be over although critics say the number is inflated but so is driving automobiles dangerous
__label__health dangerous to your health over deaths a year yet people do it because it has rewards as well as risk and
__label__health and they judge as individuals that the reward outweighs the risk this is called freedom well what are the rewards of
__label__health of cigarette smoking apart from intangible pleasure the most obvious is behavioral a battery of studies such as those by british
__label__health british researcher d m warburton show that cigarettes whatever their other effects really do stimulate alertness dexterity and cognitive capacity and
__label__health and alertness dexterity etc can be useful such as when driving or flying as congress recognized when it exempted airline pilots
__label__health pilots from the ban on smoking on domestic flights these behavioral benefits suggest an answer to the great tobacco mystery why
__label__health why almost a third of adult americans continue to do something they are told incessantly and insistently is bad for them
__label__health them duke university economist w kip viscusi reported in his book smoking making the risky decision that survey data show smokers
__label__health smokers if anything exaggerate the health danger of their habit smokers according to numerous studies such as those by university of
__label__health of michigan researchers ovide and cynthia pomerleau are different from nonsmokers they tend toward depression and excitability current understanding is that
__label__health that nicotine is amphoteric that is it can act to counter both conditions depending on how it is consumed quick puffs
__label__health puffs stimulate long drags calm the implication is fascinating a large part of the population seems to be aware of its
__label__health its significant although not pathological personality quirks and to have discovered a form of self medication that regulates them of course
__label__health course this explanation for the stubbornness of smokers is not as satisfying as what washington prefers to believe mass seduction by
__label__health by the wicked tobacco companies and their irresistible advertising nor would it justify huge rescue operations by heroic politicians and bureaucrats
__label__health bureaucrats beyond its behavioral effects smoking seems also to offer subtler health rewards to balance against its undisputed risks parkinson s
__label__health s disease the frequency of this degenerative disorder of the nervous system among smokers appears to be half the rate among
__label__health among nonsmokers an effect recognized by the surgeon general as along ago as alzheimer s disease similarly the frequency of this
__label__health this degenerative mental disorder has recently been found to be as much as less among smokers than among nonsmokers for example
__label__health example by the h studies reviewed in the international journal of epidemiology in endometrial cancer there is extensive and long standing
__label__health standing evidence that this disease of the womb occurs as much as less among smokers as documented by for example a
__label__health a new england journal of medicine article back in the triggering mechanism appears to be a reduction of estrogen levels prostate
__label__health prostate cancer conversely smoking seems to raise estrogen levels in men and may be responsible for what appears to be a
__label__health a lower rate of prostate cancer among smokers although this needs corroboration osteoarthritis this degenerative disorder of bone and cartilage is
__label__health is up to five times less likely to occur among heavy smokers as documented for example by the federal government s
__label__health s first health and nutrition examination survey colon cancer ulcerative colitis these diseases of the bowel seem to be about and
__label__health and less frequent among smokers as documented for example by articles in the journal of the american medical association and in
__label__health in the new england journal of medicine in and respectively other benefits that have been suggested for smoking lower rates of
__label__health of sarcoidosis and allergic alveolitis both lung disorders and possibly even acne smokers are also lighter ironically because obesity is a
__label__health a leading cause of the cardiovascular disease that smoking is also supposed to exacerbate so you could quit smoking and still
__label__health still die of a heart attack because of the weight you put on none of these health benefits is enough to
__label__health to persuade doctors to recommend occasional cigarettes in the way that some now occasionally recommend a glass of wine but consider
__label__health consider this theoretical possibility should year olds take up smoking because its protection against alzheimer s is more immediate that its
__label__health its potential damage to the lungs which won t show up for years if at all a theoretical possibility and likely
__label__health likely to remain theoretical research into possible benefits of tobacco and nicotine is widely reported to be stymied by the absolutist
__label__health absolutist moral fervor of the antismoking campaign under the carter administration the federal government abandoned its research into safer cigarettes in
__label__health in favor of an attack on all smoking no effort is made to encourage smokers to switch to pipes and cigars
__label__health cigars although their users lung cancer and heart disease rates are five to ten times lower somewhat offset by minor increases
__label__health increases in mouth and throat cancers there is no current support for studies of the marginal increase in danger for each
__label__health each cigarette smoked although it appears the human system can clear the effects of three to five of the much stronger
__label__health stronger pre cigarettes if dispersed across a day with relatively little risk instead the extirpation of smoking had become another moral
__label__health moral equivalent of war as president carter called the energy crisis in the s and as price and wage controls were
__label__health were viewed earlier there is no role for tradeoffs risk reward calculations or free choice why don t tobacco companies point
__label__health point out the potential offsetting rewards of smoking besides the usual corporate cowardice and bureaucratic inertia the answer may be another
__label__health another typically american disease lawyers directing the companies defense they apparently veto any suggestion that smoking has benefits for fear of
__label__health of liability suits and of the possible regulatory implications if nicotine is seen as a drug which leaves smokers defenseless against
__label__health against a second typically american disease infomania worse than marijuana many workers are always on standby to react to incoming messages
__label__health messages workers distracted by email and phone calls suffer a fall in iq more than twice that found in marijuana smokers
__label__health smokers new research has claimed the study for computing firm hewlett packard warned of a rise in infomania with people becoming
__label__health becoming addicted to email and text messages researchers found of people checked work messages at home or on the firm said
__label__health said new technology can help productivity but users must learn to switch computers and phones off losing sleep the study carried
__label__health carried out at the institute of psychiatry found excessive use of technology reduced workers intelligence those distracted by incoming email and
__label__health and phone calls saw a point fall in their iq more than twice that found in studies of the impact of
__label__health of smoking marijuana said researchers more than half of the respondents said they always responded to an email immediately or as
__label__health as soon as possible with admitting they would interrupt a meeting to do so the university of london psychologist who carried
__label__health carried out the study dr glenn wilson told the daily mail that unchecked infomania could reduce workers mental sharpness those who

__label__health2 some people appear to be born with superhero dna that cancels out genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis say researchers the study
__label__health2 study of nearly people found who should have developed debilitating diseases but did not the hope is discovering what against the
__label__health2 the odds keeps them healthy and if that could lead to new therapies experts said the approach published in nature biotechnology
__label__health2 biotechnology was fascinating but that it was still early days errors in our code of life our dna can cause disease
__label__health2 disease large numbers of studies have tried to understand these mutations by looking at people who become ill but the international
__label__health2 international team of researchers tried the opposite approach searching for people harbouring damaging mutations but who remain healthy millions of years
__label__health2 years of evolution have produced far more protective mechanisms than we currently understand said dr eric schadt from the icahn school
__label__health2 school of medicine at mount sinai hospital in new york he added most genomic studies focus on finding the cause of
__label__health2 of a disease but we see tremendous opportunity in figuring out what keeps people healthy the researchers scoured dna databases containing

__label__health2 would have manifested the disease without it being clearly annotated in their health records prof stephen friend from the icahn school
__label__health2 school of medicine said finding these individuals is a starting point to searching for the other changes eg in the genome
__label__health2 genome that might give us clues to develop therapies study the healthy don t just study the sick however this is
__label__health2 is where the tantalising story ends the scientists were unable to go out and find the lucky because of the consent
__label__health2 consent rules signed when their dna sample was taken it means they do not know what is protecting them against disease
__label__health2 disease it also leaves the team unable to prove that errors in testing bad record keeping or mosaicism in which the
__label__health2 the genetic defect affects only some cells in the body are not behind their findings because of the inability to confirm
__label__health2 confirm the source or validity of the variants and the inability to recontact the individuals this paper does not constitute a
__label__health2 a proof of principle dr ada hamosh from johns hopkins university argued and while dr scott hebbring from the university of
__label__health2 of wisconsin described the study as fascinating he also cautioned that diseases can present very differently even between patients that have
__label__health2 have same mutations some may have few symptoms at all the research group is aiming to do a new study from
__label__health2 from scratch where patients can be traced it also argues that other forms of protection from infections to dementia could be
__label__health2 be detected through this approach dr daniel macarthur from the massachusetts general hospital said finding genetic superheroes will require other kinds

__label__health2 and clinical data however he added the full benefits of such altruistic data sharing is only fully realised when it becomes
__label__health2 becomes possible to go back to the resilient individual to try to understand how their resilience is achieved this poses research

__label__health2 someone else who had been dealt a less favourable genetic hand the zika virus is scarier than first thought and its
__label__health2 its impact on the us could be greater than predicted public health officials have admitted a wider range of birth defects

__label__health2 and the mosquitoes that carry the virus could travel to more us states than previously thought she said the current zika
__label__health2 zika outbreak began almost a year ago in brazil it has been linked to thousands of birth defects in the americas
__label__health2 americas most of what we ve learned is not reassuring said dr schuchat at white house briefing on monday everything we
__label__health2 we know about this virus seems to be scarier than we initially thought earlier this year us president obama asked the
__label__health2 the us congress for bn bn in emergency funding to combat the virus in the meantime it has been using money
__label__health2 money totalling m left over from the ebola virus fund that was a temporary stopgap and inadequate to get the job
__label__health2 job done said dr anthony fauci of the national institutes of health the us now needs more money to fight the
__label__health2 the mosquitoes and to fund better research into vaccines and treatments he said when the president asked for billion we needed
__label__health2 needed billion without want to be alarmist he said there had been recent discoveries about how destructive zika appeared to be
__label__health2 be to foetal brains there were also reports of rare neurologic problems in adults he said the cdc announced that puerto

__label__health2 february the first us case of locally transmitted zika was reported in dallas texas spread through sexual contact not a mosquito
__label__health2 mosquito bite scientists have made a significant leap towards mass producing platelets the part of the blood that forms clots the
__label__health2 the nhs and university of cambridge team have discovered how to grow the body s platelet factories in the laboratory it
__label__health2 it could provide a new source of platelets to stop heavy bleeding for example after a car crash but the researchers
__label__health2 researchers need to make the process more efficient before starting trials if you donate blood then it is separated out into
__label__health2 into red blood cells plasma and platelets so patients are given only the component they need platelets are needed after trauma
__label__health2 trauma surgery leukaemia therapy and in some blood disorders like haemophilia we re totally dependent on blood donation to produce those
__label__health2 those platelets said dr cedric ghevaert a consultant haematologist his team has been trying to grow megakaryocytes the platelet mother cells
__label__health2 cells that live in your bone marrow and manufacture the clotting platelets their breakthrough reported in the journal nature communications was
__label__health2 was the discovery of a set of chemical switches needed to create megakaryocytes in the lab dr ghevaert from nhs blood
__label__health2 blood and transplant described their results as a major step forward and told the bbc news website that the next big
__label__health2 big step is to get enough platelets out of each megakaryocyte the lab made cells produce around platelets each but each
__label__health2 each one functioning normally in the bone marrow would produce up to it is hoped that recreating the same conditions as
__label__health2 as in the bone marrow could make the cells more effective if the researchers are successful then lab grown platelets could

__label__health2 they can trigger the clotting even better which would have huge advantages indeed for patients who have had a crash or
__label__health2 or a bleed or even in soldiers who have been injured it could also allow doctors to have stockpiles customised to

__label__health2 used for fever liver and lung problems scientists have discovered that the plant uses a special pathway to make chemicals with
__label__health2 with potential cancer fighting properties they say it is a step towards being able to scale up production to make new
__label__health2 new drugs prof cathie martin of the john innes centre in norwich is lead researcher of the study published in science
__label__health2 science advances working in collaboration with chinese scientists her team deduced how the plant scutellaria baicalensi synthesises the chemicals known as
__label__health2 as flavones flavones are found widely in the plant kingdom giving some plants vivid blue flowers the root is thought to
__label__health2 to have anti viral propertiesimage copyrightqing zhao chinese academy of sciences the root is thought to have anti viral properties understanding
__label__health2 understanding the pathway should help us to produce these special flavones in large quantities which will enable further research into their
__label__health2 their potential medicinal uses said prof martin it s exciting to consider that the plants which have been used as traditional
__label__health2 traditional chinese remedies for thousands of years may lead to effective modern medicines previous lab research suggests that flavones have anti
__label__health2 anti cancer properties offering hope that they may one day lead to effective cancer treatments commenting on the study dr alan
__label__health2 alan worsley of cancer research uk said this paper answers a very interesting biological question about how these plants are able
__label__health2 able to make particular molecules but the study doesn t look at whether the molecules can be used to treat cancer
__label__health2 cancer instead it looks at how this compound is made in nature which may allow scientists to make more of it
__label__health2 it in the lab and be able to research its potential uses this herb is a member of the mint family
__label__health2 family and native to china in traditional chinese medicine the root was used in combination with other plants to treat fever

__label__health2 by chinese physicians the world is facing an unrelenting march of diabetes which now affects nearly one in adults the world
__label__health2 world health organization who says in a major report it warned cases had nearly quadrupled to million in from million in
__label__health2 in high blood sugar levels are a major killer linked to million deaths around the world each year it says and
__label__health2 and officials said the numbers would continue to increase unless drastic action was taken the report lumps both type and type
__label__health2 type diabetes together but the surge in cases is predominantly down to type the form closely linked to poor lifestyle as
__label__health2 as the world s waistlines have ballooned with one in three people now overweight so too has the number of diabetes
__label__health2 diabetes cases how diabetes has taken its toll dr etienne krug the who official in charge of leading efforts against diabetes
__label__health2 diabetes told the bbc diabetes is a silent disease but it is on an unrelenting march that we need to stop
__label__health2 stop we can stop it we know what needs to be done but we cannot let it evolve like it does
__label__health2 does because it has a huge impact on people s health on families and on society failing to control levels of
__label__health2 of sugar in the blood has devastating health consequences it triples the risk of a heart attack and leaves people times
__label__health2 times more likely to have a leg amputated as well as increasing the risk of stroke kidney failure blindness and complications
__label__health2 complications in pregnancy man blinded by diabetesimage copyrightwho image caption roque and from brazil became blind years ago because of his
__label__health2 his diabetes his wife has given up her job to take care of him diabetes itself is the eighth biggest killer
__label__health2 killer in the world accounting for million deaths each year but a further million deaths are linked to high blood sugar
__label__health2 sugar levels and of the deaths were before the age of moving burden in the s the highest rates were found
__label__health2 found in affluent countries but in a remarkable transformation it is now low and middle income countries bearing the largest burden
__label__health2 burden dr krug told the bbc news website that s where we see the steepest increase knowing that s where most
__label__health2 most of the population lives in the world it does show numbers will continue to increase unless drastic action is taken
__label__health2 taken prevalence of diabetes the middle east has seen the prevalence of diabetes soar from of adults in to in dr
__label__health2 dr slim slama a who specialist in region told the bbc news website we are the region that has experienced the
__label__health2 the greatest rise in diabetes moving from million to million it is a huge huge increase in qatar or kuwait we
__label__health2 we have more than of the population with diabetes and when you look at subgroups people beyond or years old it
__label__health2 it s and things are even more worrying he said growing and ageing populations were behind part of the rise but
__label__health2 but diet and inactivity were a major problem more than three quarters of teenagers in the region are doing less than
__label__health2 than the recommended level of exercise he said the view from turkey by selin girit bbc news turkey is the country
__label__health2 country with the highest figure for growth of diabetes in europe according to turkish diabetes foundation tdf in of the population
__label__health2 population had diabetes and in only a decade this figure almost doubled and reached now it is estimated that of adult
__label__health2 adult turks are suffering from diabetes prof mehmet temel yilmaz from tdf says there is little awareness towards diabetes in turkey
__label__health2 turkey only one in five people know what diabetes is and what its causes are we don t regularly exercise we
__label__health2 we adapt to new technologies much faster than others which make us move even less and especially in the southeast of
__label__health2 of the country we have a traditional culture of fast food like doner kebabs he says as to why an increasing
__label__health2 increasing number of turkish people are getting diabetic there is also another factor dominant in turkish people s lives that does
__label__health2 does not help diabetes either stress turks it feels need to adopt a new approach to increase their quality of life
__label__health2 life eating healthy food exercising more and keeping a quiet mind seem to be the recipe action the who report said
__label__health2 said the solution required the whole of society to act the easy solution is for all of us to exercise eat
__label__health2 eat healthily and not gain excess weight of course it s not so easy said dr krug he called for governments
__label__health2 governments to regulate the fat and sugar content of foods to ensure there were healthy options available to people better urban
__label__health2 urban planning that enabled people to cycle and walk was also essential as was encouraging breastfeeding he added and he also
__label__health2 also called on the food industry to act responsibly to ensure it reduced the fat and sugar content of foods and
__label__health2 and to cease marketing unhealthy foods to young people it is only by keeping blood sugar levels in check that the
__label__health2 the deadly complications of the disease can be contained but the report showed that two thirds of low income countries were
__label__health2 were not able to provide blood sugar monitors or drugs such as insulin or metformin for most people dr krug concluded
__label__health2 concluded two things really worry me when i read this report one is that one in people today have diabetes and
__label__health2 and the other is the lack of fairness today in most low income countries people who have diabetes and need access
__label__health2 access to medicine and technology to manage it don t have access to it vitamin d supplements may help people with
__label__health2 with diseased hearts a study suggests a trial on heart failure patients found supplements of the vitamin which is made in
__label__health2 in the skin when exposed to sunlight improved their hearts ability to pump blood around the body the leeds teaching hospitals
__label__health2 hospitals team who presented at a meeting of the american college of cardiology described the results as stunning the british heart
__label__health2 heart foundation called for longer trials to assess the pills vitamin d is vital for healthy bones and teeth and may
__label__health2 may have important health benefits throughout the body but many people are deficient no safe way to suntan warning the average
__label__health2 average age of people in the study was and like many people that age they had low levels of vitamin d
__label__health2 d even in summer they do spend less time outside but the skin s ability to manufacture vitamin d also gets
__label__health2 gets less effective with age and we don t really understand why that is said consultant cardiologist dr klaus witte patients
__label__health2 patients were given either a microgram vitamin d tablet or a sugar pill placebo each day for a year and researchers
__label__health2 researchers measured the impact on heart failure a condition in which the heart becomes too weak to pump blood properly the
__label__health2 the key measure was the ejection fraction the amount of blood pumped out of the chambers of the heart with each
__label__health2 each beat in a healthy adult the figure is between and but only a quarter of the blood in the heart
__label__health2 heart was being successfully pumped out in the heart failure patients but in those taking the vitamin pills the ejection fraction
__label__health2 fraction increased from to dr witte told the bbc news website it s quite a big deal that s as big
__label__health2 big as you d expect from other more expensive treatments that we use it s a stunning effect it s as
__label__health2 as cheap as chips has no side effects and a stunning improvement on people already on optimal medical therapy it is
__label__health2 is the first time anyone has shown something like this in the last years the study also showed the patients hearts
__label__health2 hearts became smaller a suggestion they are becoming more powerful and efficient in the uk people over are advised to take
__label__health2 take microgram supplements of the vitamin however dr witte does not think high dose vitamin d should be routine prescribed just
__label__health2 just yet he told the bbc we re a little bit off that yet not because i don t believe it
__label__health2 it but data have shown improvements in heart function they may show improvements in symptoms and we now need a large
__label__health2 large study it is also not clear exactly how vitamin d is improving heart function but it is thought every cell
__label__health2 cell in the body responds to the vitamin most vitamin d comes from sunlight although it is also found in oily
__label__health2 oily fish eggs and is added to some foods such as breakfast cereals prof peter weissberg from the british heart foundation
__label__health2 foundation cautioned that the patients seemed no better at exercise and added a much bigger study over a longer period of
__label__health2 of time is now needed to determine whether these changes in cardiac function can translate into fewer symptoms and longer lives
__label__health2 lives for heart failure patients in january us president barack obama announced a moonshot for cancer let s make america the
__label__health2 the country that cures cancer once and for all he said in his last state of the nation address president obama
__label__health2 obama put vice president joe biden in charge of mission control for mr biden it s personal he lost his son
__label__health2 son beau to brain cancer at the age of last year the cancer moonshot is a bn m injection of cash
__label__health2 cash intended to bring a decade s worth of advances in just five years it is focusing on new approaches such
__label__health2 such as combining treatments and immunotherapy when drugs make the patient s own immune system turn against cancer cells there will
__label__health2 will also be more resources for new gene technologies to improve cancer detection a further area of research is into more
__label__health2 more vaccines to prevent cancer mr biden sees his role as breaking down walls and bringing all the cancer fighters together
__label__health2 together today many hospitals do not share data doctors don t always know about the latest successful therapies we re going
__label__health2 going to make sure this information is shared so an oncologist in austin texas can get access to information at md
__label__health2 md anderson a major cancer institute at the university of texas where my son was treated geographically close but no access
__label__health2 access said mr biden earlier this year more precise surgery there have been considerable improvements in recent decades in some cancer
__label__health2 cancer treatments thirty years ago patients with a cancer diagnosis had a one in four chance of surviving for more than
__label__health2 than years now that figure is close to one in two underlying that general picture it s a very mixed story
__label__health2 story says prof nic jones of manchester university and research lead for cancer research uk in testicular cancer and breast cancer
__label__health2 cancer tremendous progress has been made but in lung pancreatic and brain cancer really very little progress has been made we
__label__health2 we really need to focus our research effort on these areas a combination of targeted treatments better and earlier diagnosis and
__label__health2 and more precise surgery and radiotherapy has led to longer survival changing lifestyles such as giving up smoking has also made
__label__health2 made a difference immunotherapy is starting to make an impact but only on a few patients joe biden is leading the
__label__health2 the moonshot adrian webb is one of the lucky ones in he noticed that he had a mole that had changed
__label__health2 changed colour it turned out to be a malignant melanoma after initial treatment the disease returned and this time it had
__label__health2 had spread he was given a year to live his doctor at queen elizabeth hospital in birmingham gave him a chance
__label__health2 chance to be in a clinical trial of immunotherapy after months i was told that i was part of the team
__label__health2 team the therapy hadn t worked for the other he said the cancer had shrunk remarkably to a small part of
__label__health2 of mr webb s lung he is now well enough to run marathons there are still considerable challenges for cancer researchers
__label__health2 researchers and doctors to discover successful and safe treatments we do not have magic bullets drug costs prof jones says cancer
__label__health2 cancer is the most complex disease that we know of every individual is unique in the changes that have occurred to
__label__health2 to give cancer we need to understand cancer at a molecular level to develop more accurate treatments the new immunotherapy treatments
__label__health2 treatments are very expensive everywhere in the world the associate director for cancer prevention and control at the university of kentucky
__label__health2 kentucky prof thomas tucker says the cancer moonshot money could be put to better use this will be valuable for pharmaceutical
__label__health2 pharmaceutical companies problem is how do we pay for drugs that cost per month in the us prof tucker would like
__label__health2 like to see another bn spent on prevention of million new cases diagnosed each year in the us at least one
__label__health2 one third could be prevented if one third fewer people got cancer what kind of cost savings would that generate president
__label__health2 president nixon announced his war on cancer in cancer research uk is another organisation with moonshot like aims earmarking m to
__label__health2 to spend on five winning ideas to tackle some of the most important unanswered questions in cancer research but are campaigns
__label__health2 campaigns like these the best way to improve cancer survival more than four decades ago another american president made his own
__label__health2 own attempt in richard nixon launched what was a called a war on cancer but that war is still not won
__label__health2 won the force behind the campaign was the socialite and philanthropist mary lasker dr claire pomeroy president of the lasker foundation
__label__health2 foundation said the philanthropist s motivation dated back to when she was young visiting the family s laundress who d just
__label__health2 just had radical mastectomy for breast cancer back at a time when people didn t talk about cancer she was really
__label__health2 really struck by the suffering and the hopelessness ms lasker put a whole page advert in the washington post and new
__label__health2 new york times asking president nixon to start a war on cancer it had an enormous impact and rather than cutting
__label__health2 cutting the cancer research budget the president increased it his advisers brought in the scientists who had got men to the
__label__health2 the moon they reckoned they could find a cure for cancer in seven years but curing cancer turned out to be
__label__health2 be much more complicated than putting men on the moon did president nixon s war on cancer achieve anything medical historian
__label__health2 historian dr carsten timmermann of manchester university says a lot of new findings were already under way for example in molecular
__label__health2 molecular biology for patients there were not many tangible benefits there was publicity about the war on cancer the declaration of
__label__health2 of war may have contributed to the disappearance of stigma around cancer disappearance of stigma helps because people go and talk
__label__health2 talk to their doctors in good time the cancer moonshot task force will deliver its first report by december among its

__label__health clark posted wednesday october too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast
__label__health fast their bodies rebel and they wind up miserable wondering why anyone would possibly want to do this to themselves you
__label__health you should ease into your running program gradually in fact the beginners program we outline here is less of a running
__label__health running regimen than a walking and jogging program the idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner getting you
__label__health you running three miles or k on a regular basis in just two s it s easy to get impatient and
__label__health and you may feel tempted to skip ahead in the program but hold yourself back don t try to do more
__label__health more even if you feel you can if on the other hand you find the program too strenuous just stretch it
__label__health it out don t feel pressured to continue faster than you re able repeat weeks if needed and move ahead only
__label__health only when you feel you re ready a few minutes each week each session should take about or minutes three times
__label__health times a week that just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness
__label__health fitness this program will get you fit runners who do more than this amount are doing it for more than fitness
__label__health fitness and before long you might find yourself doing the same as well be sure to space out these three days
__label__health days throughout the week to give yourself a chance to rest and recover between efforts and don t worry about how
__label__health how fast you re going running faster can wait until your bones are stronger and your body is fitter for now
__label__health now focus on gradually increasing the time or distance you run run for time or run for distance there are two
__label__health two ways to this program to measure your runs by time or by distance either one works just as well choose
__label__health choose the option that seems easiest for you to keep track of if you go with the distance option and you
__label__health you are not using a track to measure the distances just it s not important to have the distances absolutely exact

__label__health and of course poor activation of the abdominal muscles if you are not exercising at all start gently and perform one
__label__health one set of each exercise daily for a few weeks after that you can most likely better assess what your capabilities
__label__health capabilities are with the exercises listed as progressions do the one that matches your level of ability rest about seconds between
__label__health between sets and up to one minute between exercises even if you are exercising regularly if you have recurring issues like

__label__health office a wakeup call last week i contacted some of the business leaders i greatly admire and inquired about their early
__label__health early morning schedules specifically i asked ceos and top executives what time they wake up when they have their first cup
__label__health cup of coffee when they start on email what if anything they do for exercise what time they leave for the
__label__health the office and what else they do before walking out the door i heard back from half a dozen of them
__label__health them within minutes and in a matter of a few hours i received answers from a total of out of the
__label__health the a response rate that would be the envy of any market researcher it didn t take long for the patterns
__label__health patterns to emerge based on an analysis of the executives schedules and activities i discovered seven practices you should seriously consider
__label__health consider adopting in order to make the most of your morning start early this is the part of your morning routine

__label__health rated fitness balls fitterfirst only sells authentic high quality burst resistant exercise ball chairs for marathon training guide novice program the
__label__health the full novice training schedule hit the button for the full novice training schedule people differ greatly in ability but ideally
__label__health ideally before starting a marathon program you should have been running about a year you should be able to comfortably run
__label__health run distances between and miles you should be training days a week averaging miles a week you should have run an
__label__health an occasional k or k race it is possible to run a marathon with less of a training base particularly if
__label__health if you come from another sport but the higher your fitness level the easier this week program will be this program
__label__health program consists of several different increments long runs the key to the program is the long run on weekends which builds
__label__health builds from miles in week to miles in the climactic week after that you taper to get ready for the marathon
__label__health marathon you can skip an occasional workout or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments but do not cheat on the
__label__health the long runs notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer every third week is a stepback week where
__label__health where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward rest is an important component of
__label__health of any training program run slow normally i recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from to seconds per mile
__label__health mile slower than their marathon pace the problem with offering this advice to novice runners however is that you probably don
__label__health don t know what your marathon pace is because you ve never run a marathon before don t worry simply do
__label__health do your long runs at a comfortable pace one that allows you to converse with your training partners at least during
__label__health during the beginning of the run toward the end you may need to abandon conversation and concentrate on the act of
__label__health of putting one foot in front of the other to finish however if you find yourself finishing at a pace significantly
__label__health significantly slower than your pace in the first few miles you probably need to start much slower or include regular walking
__label__health walking breaks it s better to run too slow during these long runs than too fast the important point is that
__label__health that you cover the prescribed distance how fast you cover it doesn t matter walking breaks that includes walking breaks walking
__label__health walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a marathon it works during training runs too while some coaches
__label__health coaches recommend walking minute out of every or walking minute every mile in the cara marathon training class we teach runners
__label__health runners to walk when they come to an aid station this serves a double function you can drink more easily while
__label__health while walking as opposed to running and since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations you ll be less
__label__health less likely to block those behind it s a good idea to this strategy in training as well our class that
__label__health that trains on the lakefront finds water fountains also known as bubblers every mile or more often we teach them to
__label__health to stop frequently to drink our classes that train elsewhere in the suburbs don t always have easy access to fluids
__label__health fluids but we teach them to wear a water belt and also stop frequently to drink you will lose less time
__label__health time walking than you think i once ran a marathon walking through every aid station my son kevin ran and qualified
__label__health qualified for the olympic trials employing a similar strategy and bill rodgers took four brief breaks tying a shoe on one
__label__health one of them while running and winning the boston marathon walking gives your body a chance to rest and you ll
__label__health ll be able to continue running more comfortably it s best to walk when you want to not when your fatigued
__label__health fatigued body forces you too cross training sundays in this training program are devoted to cross training what is cross training
__label__health training it is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting usually after
__label__health after your long run in this program we run long on saturdays and cross train on sundays although it certainly is
__label__health is possible to reverse that order the best cross training exercises are swimming cycling or even walking what about sports such
__label__health such as tennis or basketball activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice particularly as the mileage builds up
__label__health up toward the end of the program you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that
__label__health that requires sudden stopping and starting one tip you don t have to cross train the same each weekend and you
__label__health you could even combine two or more exercises walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a
__label__health a health club cross training for an hour on sunday will help you recover after your saturday long runs midweek training
__label__health training training during the week also should be done at a comparatively easy pace as the weekend mileage builds the weekday
__label__health weekday mileage also builds add up the numbers and you ll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the
__label__health the week as you do during long runs on the weekends midweek workouts on wednesdays build from to miles i call
__label__health call these my sorta long runs there are similar slight advances on tuesdays and thursdays the program is built on the
__label__health the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start that sounds logical doesn t it believe me
__label__health me as tens of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved it works rest despite my listing it at the
__label__health the end rest is an important component of this or any training program scientists will tell you that it is during
__label__health during the rest period the to hours between hard bouts of exercise that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger coaches
__label__health coaches also will tell you that you can t run hard unless you are well rested and it is hard running
__label__health running such as the long runs that allows you to improve if you re constantly fatigued you will fail to reach
__label__health reach your potential this is why i include two days of rest each week for novice runners if you need to
__label__health to take more rest days because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child do
__label__health do so the secret to success in any training program is consistency so as long as you are consistent with your
__label__health your training during the full weeks of the program you can afford and may benefit from extra rest interactive training if

__label__health aerobic and anaerobic aerobic exercise is muscle movement that uses oxygen to burn both carbohydrates and fats to produce energy while
__label__health while anaerobic exercise is muscle movement that does not require oxygen and only burns carbohydrates to produce energy in practice aerobic
__label__health aerobic exercise means activities such as walking bicycling or swimming that temporarily increase your heart rate and respiration aerobic exercise also
__label__health also known as cardiovascular exercise builds your endurance anaerobic exercise typically means activities such as weightlifting and push ups and sit
__label__health sit ups which builds muscle and physical strength through short bursts of strenuous activity an ideal exercise program should include both
__label__health both aerobic and anaerobic exercise basal metabolic rate bmr bmr is the number of calories per day your body burns at
__label__health at rest to maintain normal body functions such as breathing breaking down food and keeping your heart and brain working your
__label__health your age sex height weight and level of physical activity influence your bmr it tends to go down as you get
__label__health get older but it may rise if you begin exercising regularly and building more muscle mass most people s bmr is
__label__health is between and there is no target number but it can be helpful to know yours if you re starting an
__label__health an exercise program with the goal of losing weight since you may want to know how many calories you re getting
__label__health getting from food vs how many your body burns each day without exercise you can get an by using an on
__label__health on line bmr calculator endurance training vs strength or resistance training these terms correlate with aerobic and anaerobic exercise aerobic exercise
__label__health exercise builds endurance and anaerobic exercise builds strength since strength training often involves using muscles to work against the force of
__label__health of weights it s also known as resistance training strength training boosts the amount of muscle in your body by making
__label__health making your muscles work harder than they re used to another important difference is that endurance training should be done on
__label__health on most days but strength training should be performed only two or three times a week in order to give your
__label__health your muscles time to recover isotonic vs isometric exercise isotonic and isometric are both types of exercises people can do during
__label__health during strength training isotonic exercise occurs when faced with resistance it can overcome a muscle contracts and temporarily shortens thereby moving
__label__health moving the attached joint a set of bench presses or chin ups are examples of isotonic exercise by contrast isometric exercise
__label__health exercise occurs when the muscle contracts against a fixed resistance so no muscle shortening or joint movement occurs examples include pushing
__label__health pushing against a wall or trying to a lift a weight that s too heavy to budge isotonic exercise builds muscle
__label__health muscle strength and endurance without overtaxing your cardiovascular system so it s usually the foundation of a strength training program isometric
__label__health isometric exercise quickly builds muscle strength but it should be done with caution or avoided altogether because it s stressful on
__label__health on your heart and circulatory system metabolic equivalents mets metabolic equivalents are units used to the oxygen consumption a particular physical
__label__health physical activity requires and as a result its intensity one met is the d energy cost of sitting quietly as you
__label__health you engage in more vigorous activity your oxygen demands go up and so do the mets assigned to that activity for
__label__health for example activities such as walking slowly yoga and housework use about mets fast walking and doubles tennis use to and
__label__health and jogging shoveling snow and singles tennis use more than the typical person uses about milliliters of oxygen per kilogram pounds
__label__health pounds of body weight per minute that s referred to as a single met another way to think about it a
__label__health a single met is your activity intensity when you are sitting around doing nothing an activity is rated at mets if
__label__health if it requires twice as much oxygen as simply sitting milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute at
__label__health at mets if it requires four times as much oxygen and so forth sometimes met minutes or met hours are used
__label__health used to take into account how long someone exercises if you walk at a pace of three miles per hour for
__label__health for minutes you accumulate a grand total of met minutes mets x minutes met minutes jog at a pace of five
__label__health five miles per hour for minutes and met minutes redound to your physical activity credit mets x minutes met minutes physical
__label__health physical activity physical activity is any movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscle that increases energy expenditure above a basal
__label__health basal level it can be categorized by mode walking biking rowing and so and by the intensity how much work is
__label__health is being performed sometimes exercise experts use relative intensity which is a person s subjective assessment of how much effort they
__label__health they were making during a physical activity the borg scale is commonly used to measure this perceived exertion target heart rate
__label__health rate several measures of your heart rate can be useful when you begin an exercise program in addition to the number
__label__health number of beats per minute when you re idle resting heart rate and the number during peak physical activity such as
__label__health as a stress test maximum heart rate there s your target heart rate a goal that gives your heart and lungs
__label__health lungs the most benefit from a workout experts typically advise people to aim for a target heart rate of of their
__label__health their maximum rate when they re starting out and as high as as fitness improves most people s resting heart rate
__label__health rate is to beats per minute and maximum heart rate is typically about minus your age e g for a year
__label__health year old you can check whether you re hitting your target heart rate during exercise by feeling your pulse frequently or
__label__health or wearing a heart rate monitor many health centers have aerobic exercise machines with built in heart rate monitors vo max
__label__health max vo max is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during peak exertion v is for volume usually
__label__health usually measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of bodyweight per minute o is for oxygen and max is for maximum
__label__health maximum the better shape you re in the higher your vo max most adults are in the and range and endurance
__label__health endurance athletes are often between and however unless you re a runner or cyclist training to break a record you probably
__label__health probably don t need to know your vo max which is a good thing because you can only find out what

__label__health to include in the project many of the items we chose just happend to be in the wisegeek pantry we chose
__label__health chose the others because we wanted to display foods in a wide variety of categories we stayed away from prepared foods
__label__health foods such as funnel cake and spanakopita because their caloric content is closely tied to the particular recipe used we also
__label__health also avoided some more obscure foods such as mangosteen and jackfruit the sorting can be misleading because items with liquid tend

__label__health we ll swallow it by the bucket load according to some s around half the adults in the us take antioxidant
__label__health antioxidant pills daily in the belief they promote good health and stave off disease we have become antioxidant devotees but are
__label__health are they doing us any good evidence gathered over the past few years shows that at best antioxidant supplements do little
__label__health little or nothing to benefit our health at worst they may even have the opposite effect promoting the very problems they
__label__health they are supposed to stamp out it s little surprise that antioxidants have acquired a reputation as miracle health supplements as
__label__health as long ago as the s scientists discovered that many diseases including heart disease strokes cancer diabetes cataracts arthritis and neurodegenerative
__label__health neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson s and alzheimer s were linked to damage caused by highly destructive chemicals called free radicals
__label__health radicals free radicals are compounds with unpaired electrons that stabilise themselves by oxidising other molecules including proteins carbohydrates lipids and dna
__label__health dna in the process they often create more free radicals sparking off a chain of destruction oxidative damage accompanies most if
__label__health if not all diseases and has even been proposed as a direct cause of some including lung cancer atherosclerosis and alzheimer
__label__health alzheimer s free radicals are an unavoidable hazard of being alive we live in an oxygen rich atmosphere and radicals particularly
__label__health particularly reactive oxygen species ros are natural by products of respiration one per cent of the oxygen we consume turns into
__label__health into ros says biochemist barry halliwell from the national university of singapore it doesn t sound like much but humans are
__label__health are big animals and we breathe a lot over a year a human body makes kilo of ros exposure to x
__label__health x rays ozone tobacco smoke air pollutants microbial infections industrial chemicals and intensive exercise also trigger free radical production in the
__label__health the s however a potential weapon against free radical damage appeared on the horizon scientists had known for a long time
__label__health time that people whose diets are rich in fruits and vegetables have a lower incidence of heart disease diabetes dementia stroke
__label__health stroke and certain types of cancer the very diseases that are associated with free radical damage now there was an explanation
__label__health explanation fruits and vegetables are a rich source of antioxidants that can neutralise free radicals by donating electrons to them green
__label__health green plants are full of antioxidants for good reason they are especially vulnerable to oxidative stress since they produce pure oxygen
__label__health oxygen during photosynthesis to protect themselves they manufacture an assortment of potent antioxidants and so a hypothesis was born dietary antioxidants
__label__health antioxidants are free radical sponges that can stave off the diseases of old age it was a great idea putting two
__label__health two and two together scientists assumed that these antioxidants were protective and that taking them as supplements or in fortified foods
__label__health foods should decrease oxidative damage and diminish disease says halliwell who pioneered research into free radicals and disease it was simple
__label__health simple we said free radicals are bad antioxidants are good the concept helped spawn a colossal supplements industry according to the
__label__health the us national institutes of health nih more than half of us adults take some form of vitamin or mineral supplement
__label__health supplement at a total cost of billion a year the bewildering range of supplements on the shelves makes it hard to
__label__health to say how much of this expenditure goes on antioxidants but the nih says it is probably a large proportion and
__label__health and their popularity just keeps on growing spins a market research firm based in san francisco s that the antioxidant market
__label__health market has grown by per cent in the past year alone the best known antioxidants are vitamin e also known by
__label__health by its chemical name tocopherol vitamin c and two broad classes of plant chemicals called polyphenols including flavonoids and carotenoids including
__label__health including beta carotene and lycopene most supplements touted as antioxidants contain at least one of these often as a pure chemical
__label__health chemical and sometimes as a concentrated plant extract since the early s scientists have been putting these compounds through their paces
__label__health paces using double blind randomised controlled trials the gold standard for medical intervention studies time and again however the supplements failed
__label__health failed to pass the test true they knock the wind out of free radicals in a test tube but once inside
__label__health inside the human body they seem strangely powerless not only are they bad at preventing oxidative damage they can even make
__label__health make things worse many scientists are now concluding that at best they are a waste of time and money at worst
__label__health worst they could be harmful the first antioxidant to produce disappointing results was beta carotene once a star among supplements beta
__label__health beta carotene pills were recommended to smokers to protect them against lung cancer this was largely based on the observation made
__label__health made in the s that people who ate a lot of carrots which contain large quantities of beta carotene had some
__label__health some protection against cancer in researchers at the us national cancer institute set about testing beta carotene they recruited more than
__label__health than people at high risk of developing lung cancer either because they smoked or had been exposed to asbestos and gave
__label__health gave around half of them beta carotene supplements the trial was supposed to run for six years but the researchers pulled
__label__health pulled the plug two thirds of the way through after discovering to their surprise and horror that those taking supplements were
__label__health were faring worse than the controls their lung cancer rate was per cent higher and the overall death rate was up
__label__health up per cent it was a shock it not only did no good but had the potential to do harm halliwell
__label__health halliwell says the researchers couldn t be sure that these increases were not caused by chance and beta carotene capsules are
__label__health are still widely sold as an antioxidant further trials though have strengthened the evidence that beta carotene supplements not only fail
__label__health fail to protect people against cancer but can also increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers in may of this
__label__health this year an expert panel convened by the nih concluded that there was no evidence to recommend beta carotene supplements for
__label__health for the general population and strong evidence to recommend that smokers avoid it it s a similar story with the world
__label__health world s most popular antioxidant vitamin e shot to fame in the early s after two large studies involving more than
__label__health than people in total found that those with a diet high in vitamin e were significantly less likely to develop cardiovascular
__label__health cardiovascular disease the first study ed female nurses for eight years it found that the top per cent with respect to
__label__health to vitamin e consumption had a per cent lower incidence of cardiovascular disease than the bottom per cent new england journal
__label__health journal of medicine vol p the second study involving male health professionals found a similar reduction in heart disease risk new
__label__health new england journal of medicine vol p the researchers based at harvard medical school and harvard school of public health even
__label__health even had a plausible mechanism evidence was emerging that one of the causes of heart disease was free radical damage to
__label__health to ldls tiny packages of lipid and protein that circulate in the bloodstream delivering fatty acids to cells it turned out
__label__health out that adding vitamin e to blood samples in the test tube made ldl more resistant to oxidation perhaps this was
__label__health was how vitamin e prevented heart disease at the biochemical level the rationale sounded so good at that time says roland
__label__health roland stocker a biochemist at the university of new south wales in sydney australia use of vitamin e supplements soared in
__label__health in almost nobody took vitamin e by the end of the decade an d million us citizens were knocking back daily
__label__health daily doses on the back of these positive results other researchers set up large studies using vitamin e supplements the results
__label__health results however have been almost universally disappointing only one experiment the cambridge heart antioxidant study chaos found a positive effect a
__label__health a per cent reduced risk of heart attack several others found no protective effect and one even concluded that vitamin e
__label__health e increased the risk of heart failure time for a rethink other trials designed to test whether vitamin e supplements could
__label__health could prevent cancers such as the atbc study in finland also came in negative vitamin e also did not halt the
__label__health the progression to alzheimer s disease in people with mild cognitive impairment what is more when scientists went looking for evidence
__label__health evidence that vitamin e protected ldl against oxidation in the body not just in the test tube they found none except
__label__health except in people with vitamin e deficiency journal of the american medical association vol p in fact despite good evidence that
__label__health that vitamin e is a powerful antioxidant in the test tube there is now serious doubt that it acts the same
__label__health same way in the body vitamin e is not an antioxidant in fact it must be protected against oxidation says angelo
__label__health angelo azzi a biochemist at tufts university in boston massachusetts he points out that vitamin e exists in eight different forms
__label__health forms in nature all of which function as antioxidants in the test tube yet the body only uses one form alpha
__label__health alpha tocopherol which is pulled out of the bloodstream by a highly specialised protein in the liver all the other forms
__label__health forms are excreted azzi argues that evolution is unlikely to have gone to such great lengths simply to obtain an antioxidant
__label__health antioxidant from the diet there are millions of antioxidants he says vitamin e is clearly doing something in the body it
__label__health it is an essential part of the diet and deficiency leads to neurological problems but whatever it s doing it s
__label__health s not an antioxidant there is even some evidence that vitamin e supplements can be harmful last year a team led
__label__health led by edgar miller of the johns hopkins medical institutions in baltimore made headline news when they amalgamated the results of
__label__health of separate trials and concluded that high doses of vitamin e increase overall mortality annals of internal medicine vol p though
__label__health though this conclusion remains controversial it s flawed asserts azzi we re analysed the data and there is no change in
__label__health in mortality most people agree that there is no good evidence that large doses are harmful adds stocker vitamin c is
__label__health is another disappointment people are still trying to defend it but you don t get an effect on free radical damage
__label__health damage unless you start with people with a vitamin c deficiency says halliwell i think it is a lost cause in
__label__health in fact results from a vast us trial probing the links between diet and health called the women s health study
__label__health study suggest that vitamin c supplements may accelerate atherosclerosis in some people with diabetes one class of antioxidants that remains relatively
__label__health relatively unresearched is polyphenols what little evidence there is comes from epidemiological studies some of which suggest that polyphenols prevent disease
__label__health disease and others of which do not while polyphenols act as antioxidants in the test tube it is not clear that
__label__health that they are absorbed into the bloodstream and if they are they are swiftly metabolised for example per cent of a
__label__health a flavonoid called resveratrol the one found in red wine is destroyed by our digestive system before it enters circulation just
__label__health just because a food with a certain compound in it is beneficial to health it does not mean a pill with
__label__health with the same compound in is the conclusion is becoming clear whatever is behind the health benefits of a diet rich
__label__health rich in fruits and vegetables you cannot reproduce it by taking purified extracts or vitamin supplements just because a food with
__label__health with a certain compound in it is beneficial it does not mean a nutraceutical with the same compound in is said
__label__health said paul coates who works in the office of dietary supplements at nih yet the fact remains that people eating diets
__label__health diets abundant in vitamin c vitamin e polyphenols and carotenoids are less likely to suffer heart attacks vascular disease diabetes and
__label__health and cancer one explanation is that these people have a generally healthier lifestyle they exercise more and smoke less for example
__label__health example for now no one knows for sure tough vegetables there are some ideas halliwell still believes that antioxidants are at
__label__health at least partly responsible he argues that because the polyphenols carotenoids and vitamins in fruit and vegetables are bound into tough
__label__health tough fibrous material they hang around in the stomach and colon where they can neutralise free radicals the gastrointestinal tract especially
__label__health especially the stomach with its highly acidic environment is constantly generating reactive oxygen species from food supplements may not replicate this
__label__health this effect because they are digested too quickly andrew shao from the council for responsible nutrition a supplement industry trade association
__label__health association based in washington dc argues along similar lines he says that pulling a nutrient out of context and testing it
__label__health it in a clinical trial is not appropriate antioxidants should not be expected to perform as drugs he insists that s
__label__health s simply not how nutrients work they work in concert with each other there s yet another more intriguing explanation among
__label__health among the leading sources of dietary antioxidants are tea and coffee and there is some evidence that green tea in particular
__label__health particular is linked with health benefits including reduced risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease oddly though halliwell has discovered that tea
__label__health tea and coffee are also bursting with reactive oxygen species in the form of hydrogen peroxide every time you drink a
__label__health a cup of coffee it s a dilute bowl of hydrogen peroxide says halliwell the hydrogen peroxide is there because of
__label__health of the presence of the antioxidants antioxidants is really just another way of saying reducing agent which can react with oxygen
__label__health oxygen in the water to produce hydrogen peroxide think platinum blond and you get the picture of what you might be
__label__health be drinking but if free radicals are bad for us how come coffee and tea might be beneficial one possibility is
__label__health is that they can help nudge our own internal antioxidant systems into action there has been a considerable rethink as to
__label__health to what free radicals are doing says malcolm jackson a biochemist at the university of liverpool uk he believes that in
__label__health in the right quantities radicals can be positively health enhancing prompting our cells to fire up their own internal defence machinery
__label__health machinery a battery of radical busting enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase cells are very good at protecting themselves against
__label__health against minor stresses as long as they are not excessive says jackson the question is should we be quenching free radicals
__label__health radicals at all if it turns out that antioxidants in food work because they generate health promoting quantities of free radicals
__label__health radicals that would be an ironic turnaround it may also explain why supplements and extracts don t seem to work or
__label__health or may even be dangerous the doses are too high and produce too many free radicals for now the advice is
__label__health is simple stick to flavonoid rich foods red wine in moderation tea fruits and vegetables says halliwell don t start taking
__label__health taking high dose supplements or heavily fortified foods until we know more nutrient rich world s healthiest foods can promote vibrant

__label__news in focus chomsky on iran iraq and the rest of the world commentary chomsky on iran iraq and the rest of
__label__news of the world michael shank february editor john feffer irc foreign policy in focus www fpif org noam chomsky is a
__label__news a noted linguist author and foreign policy expert on february michael shank interviewed him on the latest developments in u s
__label__news s policy toward iran iraq north korea and venezuela along the way chomsky also commented on climate change the world social
__label__news social forum and why international relations are run like the mafia shank with similar nuclear developments in north korea and iran
__label__news iran why has the united states pursued direct diplomacy with north korea but refuses to do so with iran chomsky to
__label__news to say that the united states has pursued diplomacy with north korea is a little bit misleading it did under the
__label__news the clinton administration though neither side completely lived up to their obligations clinton didn t do what was promised nor did
__label__news did north korea but they were making progress so when bush came into the presidency north korea had enough uranium or
__label__news or plutonium for maybe one or two bombs but then very limited missile capacity during the bush years it s exploded
__label__news exploded the reason is he immediately canceled the diplomacy and he s pretty much blocked it ever since they made a
__label__news a very substantial agreement in september in which north korea agreed to eliminate its enrichment programs and nuclear development completely in
__label__news in return the united states agreed to terminate the threats of attack and to begin moving towards the planning for the
__label__news the provision of a light water reactor which had been promised under the framework agreement but the bush administration instantly undermined
__label__news undermined it right away they canceled the international consortium that was planning for the light water reactor which was a way
__label__news way of saying we re not going to agree to this agreement a couple of days later they started attacking the
__label__news the financial transactions of various banks it was timed in such a way to make it clear that the united states
__label__news states was not going to move towards its commitment to improve relations and of course it never withdrew the threats so
__label__news so that was the end of the september agreement that one is now coming back just in the last few days
__label__news days the way it s portrayed in the u s media is as usual with the government s party line that
__label__news that north korea is now perhaps a little more amenable to accept the september proposal so there s some optimism if
__label__news if you go across the atlantic to the financial times to review the same events they point out that an embattled
__label__news embattled bush administration it s their phrase needs some kind of victory so maybe it ll be willing to move towards
__label__news towards diplomacy it s a little more accurate i think if you look at the background but there is some minimal
__label__news minimal sense of optimism about it if you look back over the record mdash and north korea is a horrible place
__label__news place nobody is arguing about that mdash on this issue they ve been pretty rational it s been a kind of
__label__news of tit for tat history if the united states is accommodating the north koreans become accommodating if the united states is
__label__news is hostile they become hostile that s reviewed pretty well by leon sigal who s one of the leading specialists on
__label__news on this in a recent issue of current history but that s been the general picture and we re now at
__label__news at a place where there could be a settlement on north korea that s much less significant for the united states
__label__news states than iran the iranian issue i don t think has much to do with nuclear weapons frankly nobody is saying
__label__news saying iran should have nuclear weapons ndash nor should anybody else but the point in the middle east as distinct from
__label__news from north korea is that this is center of the world s energy resources originally the british and secondarily the french
__label__news french had dominated it but after the second world war it s been a u s preserve that s been an
__label__news an axiom of u s foreign policy that it must control middle east energy resources it is not a matter of
__label__news of access as people often say once the oil is on the seas it goes anywhere in fact if the united
__label__news united states used no middle east oil it d have the same policies if we went on solar energy tomorrow it
__label__news it d keep the same policies just look at the internal record or the logic of it the issue has always
__label__news always been control control is the source of strategic power dick cheney declared in kazakhstan or somewhere that control over pipeline
__label__news pipeline is a ldquo tool of intimidation and blackmail rdquo when we have control over the pipelines it s a tool
__label__news tool of benevolence if other countries have control over the sources of energy and the distribution of energy then it is
__label__news is a tool of intimidation and blackmail exactly as cheney said and that s been understood as far back as george
__label__news george kennan and the early post war days when he pointed out that if the united states controls middle east resources
__label__news resources it ll have veto power over its industrial rivals he was speaking particularly of japan but the point generalizes so
__label__news so iran is a different situation it s part of the major energy system of the world shank so when the
__label__news the united states considers a potential invasion you think it s under the premise of gaining control that is what the
__label__news the united states will gain from attacking iran chomsky there are several issues in the case of iran one is simply
__label__news simply that it is independent and independence is not tolerated sometimes it s called successful defiance in the internal record take
__label__news take cuba a very large majority of the u s population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with cuba and
__label__news and has been for a long time with some fluctuations and even part of the business world is in favor of
__label__news of it too but the government won t allow it it s attributed to the florida vote but i don t
__label__news t think that s much of an explanation i think it has to do with a feature of world affairs that
__label__news that is insufficiently appreciated international affairs is very much run like the mafia the godfather does not accept disobedience even from
__label__news from a small storekeeper who doesn t pay his protection money you have to have obedience otherwise the idea can spread
__label__news spread that you don t have to listen to the orders and it can spread to important places if you look
__label__news look back at the record what was the main reason for the u s attack on vietnam independent development can be
__label__news be a virus that can infect others that s the way it s been put kissinger in this case referring to
__label__news to allende in chile and with cuba it s explicit in the internal record arthur schlesinger presenting the report of the
__label__news the latin american study group to incoming president kennedy wrote that the danger is the spread of the castro idea of
__label__news of taking matters into your own hands which has a lot of appeal to others in the same region that suffer
__label__news suffer from the same problems later internal documents charged cuba with successful defiance of u s policies going back years ndash
__label__news ndash to the monroe doctrine and that can t be tolerated so there s kind of a state commitment to ensuring
__label__news ensuring obedience going back to iran it s not only that it has substantial resources and that it s part of
__label__news of the world s major energy system but it also defied the united states the united states as we know overthrew
__label__news overthrew the parliamentary government installed a brutal tyrant was helping him develop nuclear power in fact the very same programs that
__label__news that are now considered a threat were being sponsored by the u s government by cheney wolfowitz kissinger and others in
__label__news in the s as long as the shah was in power but then the iranians overthrew him and they kept u
__label__news u s hostages for several hundred days and the united states immediately turned to supporting saddam hussein and his war against
__label__news against iran as a way of punishing iran the united states is going to continue to punish iran because of its
__label__news its defiance so that s a separate factor and again the will of the u s population and even us business
__label__news business is considered mostly irrelevant seventy five percent of the population here favors improving relations with iran instead of threats but
__label__news but this is disregarded we don t have polls from the business world but it s pretty clear that the energy
__label__news energy corporations would be quite happy to be given authorization to go back into iran instead of leaving all that to
__label__news to their rivals but the state won t allow it and it is setting up confrontations right now very explicitly part
__label__news part of the reason is strategic geo political economic but part of the reason is the mafia complex they have to
__label__news to be punished for disobeying us shank venezuela has been successfully defiant with chavez making a swing towards socialism where are
__label__news are they on our list chomsky they re very high the united states sponsored and supported a military coup to overthrow
__label__news overthrow the government in fact that s its last most recent effort in what used to be a conventional resort to
__label__news to such measures shank but why haven t we turned our sights more toward venezuela chomsky oh they re there there
__label__news there s a constant stream of abuse and attack by the government and therefore the media who are almost reflexively against
__label__news against venezuela for several reasons venezuela is independent it s diversifying its exports to a limited extent instead of just being
__label__news being dependent on exports to the united states and it s initiating moves toward latin american integration and independence it s
__label__news s what they call a bolivarian alternative and the united states doesn t like any of that this again is defiance
__label__news defiance of u s policies going back to the monroe doctrine there s now a standard interpretation of this trend in
__label__news in latin america another kind of party line latin america is all moving to the left from venezuela to argentina with
__label__news with rare exceptions but there s a good left and a bad left the good left is garcia and lula and
__label__news and then there s the bad left which is chavez morales maybe correa and that s the split in order to
__label__news to maintain that position it s necessary to resort to some fancy footwork for example it s necessary not to report
__label__news report the fact that when lula was re elected in october his foreign trip and one of his first acts was
__label__news was to visit caracas to support chavez and his electoral campaign and to dedicate a joint venezuelan brazilian project on the
__label__news the orinoco river to talk about new projects and so on it s necessary not to report the fact that a
__label__news a couple of weeks later in cochabamba bolivia which is the heart of the bad guys there was a meeting of
__label__news of all south american leaders there had been bad blood between chavez and garcia but it was apparently patched up they
__label__news they laid plans for pretty constructive south american integration but that just doesn t fit the u s agenda so it
__label__news it wasn t reported shank how is the political deadlock in lebanon impacting the u s government s decision to potentially
__label__news potentially go to war with iran is there a relationship at all chomsky there s a relationship i presume part of
__label__news of the reason for the u s israel invasion of lebanon in july mdash and it is us israeli the lebanese
__label__news lebanese are correct in calling it that mdash part of the reason i suppose was that hezbollah is considered a deterrent
__label__news deterrent to a potential u s israeli attack on iran it had a deterrent capacity i e rockets and the goal
__label__news goal i presume was to wipe out the deterrent so as to free up the united states and israel for an
__label__news an eventual attack on iran that s at least part of the reason the official reason given for the invasion can
__label__news can t be taken seriously for a moment that s the capture of two israeli soldiers and the killing of a
__label__news a couple others for decades israel has been capturing and kidnapping lebanese and palestinian refugees on the high seas from cyprus
__label__news cyprus to lebanon killing them in lebanon bringing them to israel holding them as hostages it s been going on for
__label__news for decades has anybody called for an invasion of israel of course israel doesn t want any competition in the region
__label__news region but there s no principled basis for the massive attack on lebanon which was horrendous in fact one of the
__label__news the last acts of the u s israeli invasion right after the ceasefire was announced before it was implemented was to
__label__news to saturate much of the south with cluster bombs there s no military purpose for that the war was over the
__label__news the ceasefire was coming un de mining groups that are working there say that the scale is unprecedented it s much
__label__news much worse than any other place they ve worked kosovo afghanistan iraq anywhere there are supposed to be about one million
__label__news million bomblets left there a large percentage of them don t explode until you pick them up a child picks them
__label__news them up or a farmer hits it with a hoe or something so what it does basically is make the south
__label__news south uninhabitable until the mining teams for which the united states and israel don t contribute clean it up this is
__label__news is arable land it means that farmers can t go back it means that it may undermine a potential hezbollah deterrent
__label__news deterrent they apparently have pretty much withdrawn from the south according to the un you can t mention hezbollah in the
__label__news the u s media without putting in the context of ldquo iranian supported hezbollah rdquo that s its name its name
__label__news name is iranian supported hezbollah it gets iranian support but you can mention israel without saying us supported israel so this
__label__news this is more tacit propaganda the idea that hezbollah is acting as an agent of iran is very dubious it s
__label__news s not accepted by specialists on iran or specialists on hezbollah but it s the party line or sometimes you can
__label__news can put in syria i e ldquo syrian supported hezbollah rdquo but since syria is of less interest now you have
__label__news have to emphasize iranian support shank how can the u s government think an attack on iran is feasible given troop
__label__news troop availability troop capacity and public sentiment chomsky as far as i m aware the military in the united states thinks
__label__news thinks it s crazy and from whatever leaks we have from intelligence the intelligence community thinks it s outlandish but not
__label__news not impossible if you look at people who have really been involved in the pentagon s strategic planning for years people
__label__news people like sam gardiner they point out that there are things that possibly could be done i don t think any
__label__news any of the outside commentators at least as far as i m aware have taken very seriously the idea of bombing
__label__news bombing nuclear facilities they say if there will be bombing it ll be carpet bombing so get the nuclear facilities but
__label__news but get the rest of the country too with an exception by accident of geography the world s major oil resources
__label__news resources are in shi ite dominated areas iran s oil is concentrated right near the gulf which happens to be an
__label__news an arab area not persian khuzestan is arab has been loyal to iran fought with iran not iraq during the iran
__label__news iran iraq war this is a potential source of dissension i would be amazed if there isn t an attempt going
__label__news going on to stir up secessionist elements in khuzestan u s forces right across the border in iraq including the surge
__label__news surge are available potentially to ldquo defend rdquo an independent khuzestan against iran which is the way it would be put
__label__news put if they can carry it off shank do you think that s what the surge was for chomsky that s
__label__news s one possibility there was a release of a pentagon war gaming report in december with gardiner leading it it was
__label__news was released and published in the atlantic ly they couldn t come up with a proposal that didn t lead to
__label__news to disaster but one of the things they considered was maintaining troop presence in iraq beyond what s to be used
__label__news used in iraq for troop replacement and so on and use them for a potential land move in iran presumably khuzestan
__label__news khuzestan where the oil is if you could carry that off you could just bomb the rest of the country to
__label__news to dust again i would be amazed if there aren t efforts to sponsor secessionist movements elsewhere among the azeri population
__label__news population for example it s a very complex ethnic mix in iran much of the population isn t persian there are
__label__news are secessionist tendencies anyway and almost certainly without knowing any of the facts the united states is trying to stir them
__label__news them up to break the country internally if possible the strategy appears to be try to break the country up internally
__label__news internally try to impel the leadership to be as harsh and brutal as possible that s the immediate consequence of constant
__label__news constant threats everyone knows that that s one of the reasons the reformists shirin ebadi and akbar ganji and others are
__label__news are bitterly complaining about the u s threats that it s undermining their efforts to reform and democratize iran but that
__label__news that s presumably its purpose since it s an obvious consequence you have to assume it s the purpose just like
__label__news like in law anticipated consequences are taken as the evidence for intention and here s it so obvious you can t
__label__news t seriously doubt it so it could be that one strain of the policy is to stir up secessionist movements particularly
__label__news particularly in the oil rich regions the arab regions near the gulf also the azeri regions and others second is to
__label__news to try to get the leadership to be as brutal and harsh and repressive as possible to stir up internal disorder
__label__news disorder and maybe resistance and a third is to try to pressure other countries and europe is the most amenable to
__label__news to join efforts to strangle iran economically europe is kind of dragging its feet but they usually go along with the
__label__news the united states the efforts to intensify the harshness of the regime show up in many ways for example the west
__label__news west absolutely adores ahmadinejad any wild statement that he comes out with immediately gets circulated in headlines and mistranslated they love
__label__news love him but anybody who knows anything about iran presumably the editorial offices knows that he doesn t have anything to
__label__news to do with foreign policy foreign policy is in the hands of his superior the supreme leader khamenei but they don
__label__news don t report his statements particularly when his statements are pretty conciliatory for example they love when ahmadinejad says that israel
__label__news israel shouldn t exist but they don t like it when khamenei right afterwards says that iran supports the arab league
__label__news league position on israel palestine as far as i m aware it never got reported actually you could find khamenei s
__label__news s more conciliatory positions in the financial times but not here and it s repeated by iranian diplomats but that s
__label__news s no good the arab league proposal calls for normalization of relations with israel if it accepts the international consensus of
__label__news of the two state settlement which has been blocked by the united states and israel for thirty years and that s
__label__news s not a good story so it s either not mentioned or it s hidden somewhere it s very hard to
__label__news to predict the bush administration today because they re deeply irrational they were irrational to start with but now they re
__label__news re desperate they have created an unimaginable catastrophe in iraq this should ve been one of the easiest military occupations in
__label__news in history and they succeeded in turning it into one of the worst military disasters in history they can t control
__label__news control it and it s almost impossible for them to get out for reasons you can t discuss in the united
__label__news united states because to discuss the reasons why they can t get out would be to concede the reasons why they
__label__news they invaded we re supposed to believe that oil had nothing to do with it that if iraq were exporting pickles
__label__news pickles or jelly and the center of world oil production were in the south pacific that the united states would ve
__label__news ve liberated them anyway it has nothing to do with the oil what a crass idea anyone with their head screwed
__label__news screwed on knows that that can t be true allowing an independent and sovereign iraq could be a nightmare for the
__label__news the united states it would mean that it would be shi ite dominated at least if it s minimally democratic it
__label__news it would continue to improve relations with iran just what the united states doesn t want to see and beyond that
__label__news that right across the border in saudi arabia where most of saudi oil is there happens to be a large shi
__label__news shi ite population probably a majority moves toward sovereignty in iraq stimulate pressures first for human rights among the bitterly repressed
__label__news repressed shi ite population but also toward some degree of autonomy you can imagine a kind of a loose shi ite
__label__news ite alliance in iraq saudi arabia and iran controlling most of the world s oil and independent of the united states
__label__news states and much worse although europe can be intimidated by the united states china can t it s one of the
__label__news the reasons the main reasons why china is considered a threat we re back to the mafia principle china has been
__label__news been there for years has contempt for the barbarians is overcoming a century of domination and simply moves on its own
__label__news own it does not get intimidated when uncle sam shakes his fist that s scary in particular it s dangerous in
__label__news in the case of the middle east china is the center of the asian energy security grid which includes the central
__label__news central asian states and russia india is also hovering around the edge south korea is involved and iran is an associate
__label__news associate member of some kind if the middle east oil resources around the gulf which are the main ones in the
__label__news the world if they link up to the asian grid the united states is really a second rate power a lot
__label__news lot is at stake in not withdrawing from iraq i m sure that these issues are discussed in internal planning it
__label__news it s inconceivable that they can t think of this but it s out of public discussion it s not in
__label__news in the media it s not in the journals it s not in the baker hamilton report and i think you
__label__news you can understand the reason to bring up these issues would open the question why the united states and britain invaded
__label__news invaded and that question is taboo it s a principle that anything our leaders do is for noble reasons it may
__label__news may be mistaken it may be ugly but basically noble and if you bring in normal moderate conservative strategic economic objectives
__label__news objectives you threatening that principle it s remarkable the extent to which it s held so the original pretexts for the
__label__news the invasion were weapons of mass destruction and ties to al qaida that nobody but maybe wolfowitz or cheney took seriously
__label__news seriously the single question as they kept reiterating in the leadership was will saddam give up his programs of weapons of
__label__news of mass destruction the single question was answered a couple of s later the wrong way and quickly the party line
__label__news line shifted in november bush announced his freedom agenda our real goal is to bring democracy to iraq to transform the
__label__news the middle east that became the party line instantly but it s a mistake to pick out individuals because it s
__label__news s close to universal even in scholarship in fact you can even find scholarly articles that begin by giving the evidence
__label__news evidence that it s complete farce but nevertheless accept it there was a pretty good study of the freedom agenda in
__label__news in current history by two scholars and they give the facts they point out that the freedom agenda was announced on
__label__news on november after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction but the freedom agenda is real even if there s
__label__news s no evidence for it in fact if you look at our policies they re the opposite take palestine there was
__label__news was a free election in palestine but it came out the wrong way so instantly the united states and israel with
__label__news with europe tagging along moved to punish the palestinian people and punish them harshly because they voted the wrong way in
__label__news in a free election that s accepted here in the west as perfectly normal that illustrates the deep hatred and contempt
__label__news contempt for democracy among western elites so deep seated they can t even perceive it when it s in front of
__label__news of their eyes you punish people severely if they vote the wrong way in a free election there s a pretext
__label__news pretext for that too repeated every day hamas must agree to first recognize israel second to end all violence third to
__label__news to accept past agreements try to find a mention of the fact that the united states and israel reject all three
__label__news three of those they obviously don t recognize palestine they certainly don t withdraw the use of violence or the threat
__label__news threat of it in fact they insist on it and they don t accept past agreements including the road map i
__label__news i suspect one of the reasons why jimmy carter s book has come under such fierce attack is because it s
__label__news s the first time i think in the mainstream that one can find the truth about the road map i have
__label__news have never seen anything in the mainstream that discusses the fact that israel instantly rejected the road map with u s
__label__news s support they formally accepted it but added reservations that totally eviscerated it it was done instantly it s public knowledge
__label__news knowledge i ve about it talked about it so have others but i ve never seen it mentioned in the mainstream
__label__news mainstream before and obviously they don t accept the arab league proposal or any other serious proposal in fact they ve
__label__news ve been blocking the international consensus on the two state solution for decades but hamas has to accept them it really
__label__news really makes no sense hamas is a political party and political parties don t recognize other countries and hamas itself has
__label__news has made it very clear they actually carried out a truce for a year and a half didn t respond to
__label__news to israeli attacks and have called for a long term truce during which it d be possible to negotiate a settlement
__label__news settlement along the lines of the international consensus and the arab league proposal all of this is obvious it s right
__label__news right on the surface and that s just one example of the deep hatred of democracy on the part of western
__label__news western elites it s a striking example but you can add case after case yet the president announced the freedom agenda
__label__news agenda and if the dear leader said something it s got to be true kind of north korean style therefore there
__label__news there s a freedom agenda even if there s a mountain of evidence against it the only evidence for it is
__label__news is in words even apart from the timing shank in the presidential election how will the candidates approach iran do you
__label__news you think iran will be a deciding factor in the elections chomsky what they re saying so far is not encouraging
__label__news encouraging i still think despite everything that the us is very unlikely to attack iran it could be a huge catastrophe
__label__news catastrophe nobody knows what the consequences would be i imagine that only an administration that s really desperate would resort to
__label__news to that but if the democratic candidates are on the verge of winning the election the administration is going to be
__label__news be desperate it still has the problem of iraq can t stay in and can t get out shank the senate
__label__news senate democrats can t seem to achieve consensus on this issue chomsky i think there s a reason for it the
__label__news the reason is just thinking through the consequences of allowing an independent partially democratic iraq the consequences are nontrivial we may
__label__news may decide to hide our heads in the sand and pretend we can t think it through because we cannot allow
__label__news allow the question of why the united states invaded to open but that s very self destructive shank is there any
__label__news any connection to this conversation and why we cannot find the political will and momentum to enact legislation that would reduce
__label__news reduce c emissions levels institute a cap and trade system etc chomsky it s perfectly clear why the united states didn
__label__news didn t sign the kyoto protocol again there s overwhelming popular support for signing in fact it s so strong that
__label__news that a majority of bush voters in thought that he was in favor of the kyoto protocol it s such an
__label__news an obvious thing to support popular support for alternative energy has been very high for years but it harms corporate profits
__label__news profits after all that s the administration s constituency i remember talking to years ago one of the leading people in
__label__news in the government who was involved in arms control pressing for arms control measures d eacute tente and so on he
__label__news he s very high up and we were talking about whether arms control could succeed and only partially as a joke
__label__news joke he said ldquo well it might succeed if the high tech industry makes more profit from arms control than it
__label__news it can make from weapons related research and production if we get to that tipping point maybe arms control will work
__label__news work rdquo he was partially joking but there s a truth that lies behind it shank how do we move forward
__label__news forward on climate change without beggaring the south chomsky unfortunately the poor countries the south are going to suffer the worst
__label__news worst according to most projections mdash and that being so it undermines support in the north for doing much look at
__label__news at the ozone story as long as it was the southern hemisphere that was being threatened there was very little talk
__label__news talk about it when it was discovered in the north very quickly actions were taken to do something about it right
__label__news right now there s discussion of putting serious effort into developing a malaria vaccine because global warming might extend malaria to
__label__news to the rich countries so something should be done about it same thing on health insurance here s an issue where
__label__news where for the general population it s been the leading domestic issue or close to it for years and there s
__label__news s a consensus for a national healthcare system on the model of other industrial countries maybe expanding medicare to everyone or
__label__news or something like that well that s off the agenda nobody can talk about that the insurance companies don t like
__label__news like it the financial industry doesn t like and so on now there s a change taking place what s happening
__label__news happening is that manufacturing industries are beginning to turn to support for it because they re being undermined by the hopelessly
__label__news hopelessly inefficient u s healthcare system it s the worst in the industrial world by far and they have to pay
__label__news pay for it since it s employer compensated in part their production costs are much higher than those competitors who have
__label__news have a national healthcare system take gm if it produces the same car in detroit and in windsor across the border
__label__news border in canada it saves i forget the number i think over with the windsor production because there s a national
__label__news national healthcare system it s much more efficient it s much cheaper it s much more effective so the manufacturing industry
__label__news industry is starting to press for some kind of national healthcare now it s beginning to put it on the agenda
__label__news agenda it doesn t matter if the population wants it what of the population wants would be kind of irrelevant but
__label__news but if part of the concentration of corporate capital that basically runs the country another thing we re not allowed to
__label__news to say but it s obvious if part of that sector becomes in favor then the issue moves onto the political
__label__news political agenda shank so how does the south get its voice heard on the international agenda is the world social forum
__label__news forum a place for it chomsky the world social forum is very important but of course that can t be covered
__label__news covered in the west in fact i remember reading an article i think in the financial times about the two major
__label__news major forums that were taking place one was the world economic forum in davos and a second was a forum in
__label__news in herzeliyah in israel a right wing forum in herzeliyah those were the two forums of course there was also the
__label__news the world social forum in nairobi but that s only tens of thousands of people from around the world shank with
__label__news with the trend towards vilifying the g at the un one wonders where the developing world can effectively voice their concerns
__label__news concerns chomsky the developing world voice can be amplified enormously by support from the wealthy and the privileged otherwise it s
__label__news s very likely to be marginalized as in every other issue shank so it s up to us foreign policy in

__label__news martyred people thanks for reading all that name robert castle date feb the role of the neocons in our government since
__label__news since they invaded and occupied the white house is seldom if ever mentioned by the main stream media my information sources
__label__news sources are limited and it is difficult to assess their credibility but the argument can be made that but for the
__label__news the neocons we would not be in danger of permanently losing our democracy with its rights and obligations duties and privileges
__label__news privileges the united states is in the middle of a de facto civil war the combatants are the neocons and their
__label__news their allies the industrial military complex the main stream media and the fundamentalists on one side and those who are defending
__label__news defending our constitution and the rule of law in general foreign and domestic the true patriots on the other the united
__label__news united states cannot be both a militaristic empire and a democracy such as was built on the principles set forth in
__label__news in our constitution only one side can win name alexander syrus date feb thanks to mr shank for conducting this interveiw
__label__news interveiw with mr chomsky who has articulated the truth once again it is indeed the mafia principle that has been the
__label__news the basic rationale for us foreign policy as a whole for several decades while it s no surprise that g countries
__label__news countries have been shamefully the major client states and will bend over backward to please their master i wonder what it
__label__news it will take to wake up the american public to the fact that their leaders and elites despise democracy if at
__label__news at all such a phenomenon really exists in its entire sense name john anderson date feb go to asian times website
__label__news website where a letter writer chomsky apart name art costa date feb first i want to thank you for yet another
__label__news another insightful discussion with noam chomsky i don t think american imperialism is a neocon invention probably it s zenith is
__label__news is the wilsonian doctrine but it goes back to the monroe doctrine in terms of an articulated policy in the american
__label__news american hemisphere that said i think our foreign policy has shaped our democracy such as it is it was born from
__label__news from progressive documents us constitution bill of rights and the declaration of independence but is pre and post dated through countless
__label__news countless wars of expansionism first in the us and then abroad and continues to this day the arrogance of power or
__label__news or specifically imperialistic interventionism and as chomsky aptly characterizes it as the mafia principle is inherent in a uni polar world
__label__news world whether we talk about darfur or afganistan or iraq we are always honing in on a role of intervention in
__label__news in essentially all of these situations the context is from one perspective american western hegemony we rarely truly understand the complexity
__label__news complexity the history and the nuances of nations such as darfur or rwanda and most certainly iraq occasionally we see horrible
__label__news horrible conflict and want to stop it and through military inteversion we exchange their horror for the one we perpetrate through
__label__news through our force more frequently it is pure unadulterated control of a region and its resources or purposes of pure arrogance
__label__news arrogance the art of life and peace must supplant that of war as the tool for altering the course of conflict
__label__news conflict war has always begotten war regardless of intentions until we understand and act on it professor chomsky will always have
__label__news have sufficient material for his interviews and essays name alexander syrus date feb mr andersron s reference to a letter in
__label__news in asian times taking chomsky apart is a typical example of dangerous ignorance that feeds and conforms to the mafia mentality
__label__news mentality prevalant in the us foreign policy this thread is not about defending or attacking chomsky but rather about the hypocricy
__label__news hypocricy and double standards of us foreign policy only unnoticed by the fanatics and the profiteers instead of getting all excited
__label__news excited about one letter in asian times i invite you to read a little more that is if you can take
__label__news take some time off eating burgers and oninon rings or fish and chips for that matter and watching fox news of
__label__news of contemporary policitial history you seemed to have totally missed the point as it is not about right left or somewhere
__label__news somewhere in between either it s about historical facts that depict the sufferings of millions of people americans included to further
__label__news further inform you and as a multilingual person i would like to add that the language that one speaks shapes the
__label__news the way that one thinks so it should not be surprising that chomsky being a linguist has a much deeper understanding
__label__news understanding of the kind of thinking that makes up irrational and dangerous policies which when implemented only make the world much
__label__news much more insecure as we are all witnessing at the moment you may add a new comment here it will not

__label__news analysis at deepmarket says february th at pm i was over at digg this morning and ran across an article titled
__label__news titled nations in debt it s bad and getting worse from the creditcave blog the article is very well researched but
__label__news but i cannot agree with the conclusions the basic argument is that the united states has huge amounts of debt especially
__label__news especially when compared to other countries well yes the us has some big numbers when it comes to the national debt
__label__news debt trillion dollars this did not surprise me what did surprise me was the japan has an trillion dollar national debt
__label__news debt roman says february th at pm what about russia art says february th at pm debt by itself isn t
__label__news t a very meaningful figure our national income of trillion offsets the debt and about trillion of that debt is intragovernmental
__label__news intragovernmental debt the sky isn t falling our tax revenues thanks to our growing economy are at record highs the deficit
__label__news deficit is coming down despite wars corporate scandal housing slowdown hurricanes etc the main goal should be to keep the economy
__label__news economy growing tax revenues will increase the deficit will go down and possibly revert to surpluses jess says february th at
__label__news at pm good post but your confusing national debt with collective personal debt the national debt has little to do with
__label__news with house prices and your credit cards also debt as a percentage of gdp might be a better way to compare

__label__news that drains ones energy energy being the only real thing we all have the reason for all of this seems to
__label__news to be in the nature of power amp control over all things from political social economic and religious controlled slaves even
__label__news even happy slaves as in denmark with a tax rate paying for all their so called social welfare is what the
__label__news the big boys and their political allies are aiming for this spells imminent destruction of the middle classes as they are
__label__news are the least controllable element wthin all societies being educated liberal minded and dare i say more caring about issues and
__label__news and often unwilling to toe the line the real questioning attitude appears to come mostly from the middle classes therefore destroy
__label__news destroy that which can t be controlled there is no difference between national amp personal debt it is all debt stemming
__label__news stemming from this culture based on the fraudulent idea of that credit is a good thing this is fed to us
__label__news us from the top down from all the governements and banks down they cannot function without conscripting the rest of us

__label__news doom and gloom kj last year the average american spent more than he earned again representing the lowest personal savings rate
__label__news rate since the great depression so called negative saving is grossly misrepresentative of reality the way this saving rate is calculated
__label__news calculated is by finding the difference between disposable income and consumption expenditures why is this misrepresentative because this does not include
__label__news include your k or social security many americans view their k and social security payments as sufficient for saving so they
__label__news they spend much of the rest that s why this figure of negative saving is ridiculous and useless micropayments and trickle

__label__news policy project mpp a washington d c group advocating the review and liberalization of marijuana laws at times the report uses
__label__news uses some debatable assumptions for instance miron assumes a single figure for every type of arrest for example but the average
__label__news average pot bust is likely cheaper than bringing in a murder or kidnapping suspect friedman and other economists however say the
__label__news the overall work is some of the best yet done on the costs of the war on marijuana at friedman is
__label__news is revered as one of the great champions of free market capitalism during the years of u s rivalry with communism
__label__news communism he is also passionate about the need to legalize marijuana among other drugs for both financial and moral reasons there
__label__news there is no logical basis for the prohibition of marijuana the economist says billion is a lot of money but that
__label__news that is one of the lesser evils our failure to successfully enforce these laws is responsible for the deaths of thousands
__label__news thousands of people in colombia i haven t even included the harm to young people it s absolutely disgraceful to think
__label__news think of picking up a year old for smoking pot more disgraceful is the denial of marijuana for medical purposes securing
__label__news securing the signatures of friedman along with economists from cornell stanford and yale universities among others is a coup for the

__label__news created by these laws the costs are one of the lesser evils not that a man of his years expects reason
__label__news reason to triumph any added revenues from taxing legal marijuana would almost certainly be more than spent by this or any
__label__news any other congress deficits are the only thing that keeps this congress from spending more says friedman republicans are no different

__label__news held at the ritzy bellagio hotel and casino in las vegas summers told the crowd that he shared concerns that low
__label__news low interest rates could be causing new bubbles that s why summers said he has long favored government spending on jobs
__label__news jobs programs rather than stimulus engineered by the fed what s more summers said that the fed s policies are likely

__label__news stocks more than the rest of the country a policy that works by pumping up asset prices is not going to

__label__news to pull off last year summers was in a two way race with janet yellen to be the next head of

__label__news who was also on stage with summers said he was concerned that we could have another financial crisis when interest rates
__label__news rates rise summers countered by saying that was unlikely banks are in much better shape than they were a few years
__label__news years ago he explained the major financial institutions are much better capitalized than in the past says summers will they always
__label__news always be it s a good thing to question taleb said he thought the financial system had not really been fixed
__label__news fixed since the financial crisis and that we were setting ourselves up for more and larger bailouts summers said the answer
__label__news answer was more capital and closer monitoring of the banks and not some alternative in your plan we have a system
__label__news system with two types of financial firms one would be like a utility that can fail and be bailed out but
__label__news but the government gets to set those banks salaries and basically say what they can do said summers then there s
__label__news s the let s call it the let it rip part of the financial system and hope it works out summers
__label__news summers said he thought the first group of firms the ones that chose government control would be small and the second

__label__news laid out three key reasons why the fed may keep its short term interest rate the federal funds rate below historic
__label__news historic averages for the long haul that rate is important because it impacts rates for mortgages and loans listen up because
__label__news because dudley is a top decision maker at the central bank and closely aligned with current fed chair janet yellen the
__label__news the economy remains weak like it or not the economy is still disappointing on several fronts and that may not change
__label__news change anytime soon economic headwinds seem likely to persist for several more years dudley said in a speech to the new
__label__news new york association of business economics he notes that the great recession scarred households and businesses which is likely to dampen
__label__news dampen their spending and investment for a long time meanwhile the housing sector is facing several significant headwinds he said related
__label__news related janet yellen s big concern is a housing slowdown take these three for example mortgages are still hard to come
__label__news come by for homebuyers with all but the most pristine credit histories high levels of student debt are delaying young people
__label__news people from becoming first time home buyers finally housing supply remains limited our future potential is declining remember the economic good
__label__news good times say the clinton years or the mid s in the future the u s economy has lower potential to
__label__news to grow at the strong rates it did in the s and s mainly because a huge portion of the population
__label__news population is retiring yes we re talking about you baby boomers lower economic potential implies interest rates will have to remain
__label__news remain low even after the economy starts revving up again dudley said bank regulation ing the massive crash in banks these
__label__news these days are required to hold a larger cushion of cash on the sidelines for emergencies while these higher capital requirements
__label__news requirements are essential in order to make the financial system more robust dudley said this is likely to cause the fed
__label__news fed to keep low interest rates in place in the future why traditionally banks make their money by taking in your
__label__news your deposits and paying you a certain interest rate but then lending that money out to someone else at a higher
__label__news higher rate if banks are forced to hold more cash on the sidelines they may become less profitable and may slow
__label__news slow their lending if the fed wants to continue stimulating the economy this means it may have to keep interest rates
__label__news rates lower than usual to achieve its desired impact on the economy okay so you may have missed the boat on
__label__news on locking in a year mortgage last year but even so rates on mortgages and other loans will probably stay near
__label__news near their historic lows for years to come since the fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero but in
__label__news in better economic times that rate averaged going forward fed officials have said they expect to start raising rates sometime next

__label__news redistribution could actually improve real world macro efficiency just not micro efficiency as defined by micro economics see a collection of
__label__news of political cartoons on the economy for that reason pursing such efficiency probably has much to do with making an economy
__label__news economy less productive in the long run classical definitions of efficiency aspire to an objective definition of value so that spending
__label__news spending million to save bill gates life is worth it simply because gates is willing to spend the million while spending
__label__news spending the same amount to save a poor individual is not because well what poor person is going to spend million
__label__news million on medical care of course some would argue that gates is worth spending million to save for the same reason
__label__news reason he has the million to spend he s a successful maker whereas the poor person is a proven loser this
__label__news this basically assumes though that the contribution all individuals can make to future economic growth is directly related to their monetary
__label__news monetary resources at present this is contradicted by the vast number of creators from entrepreneurs to scientists who start in poverty
__label__news poverty are in fact often driven to succeed by their humble origins and who form what evidence there is for the
__label__news the conservative position that making it tough on the poor is good for them because it incentivizes achievement and that brings
__label__news brings us closer to an explanation for the results krugman cites giving more people a shot at economic success produces greater
__label__news greater gains for society because more people are contributing this is hardly startling news the world bank study of the arab
__label__news arab world a few years back concluded that the major reason why arab countries languish economically is because their exclusion of
__label__news of women from the economic mainstream eliminates half the population s possible contribution to growth from the get go for the
__label__news the same reason many development efforts in sub saharan africa now focus on getting education for more young girls this isn
__label__news isn t just a gender issue any systematic exclusion of large percentages of the population from the instruments of success particularly
__label__news particularly education hobbles an entire society a good deal of america s prowess is due to the historical fact that more
__label__news more or less anyone could make it here not just the aristocracy not just those of anglo saxon extraction and that
__label__news that s in large part because more or less everyone was invested with an education thanks to a national commitment that
__label__news that might be attacked today as socialist except that it dates back to the founding congress see a collection of political
__label__news political cartoons on congress the fact that bringing in more outsiders benefits not just those outsiders themselves but also those already
__label__news already on the inside sounds an awful lot like something i discussed here a few weeks ago poverty as a lack
__label__news lack of access to networks the defining characteristic of networks is that everyone gains from others joining the network phones faxes
__label__news faxes the internet all are more valuable to you the more others are connected to them so it s not hard
__label__news hard to see how reducing inequality at least in terms of access to opportunities and resources leads to greater growth for
__label__news for society as a whole my argument has been that lack of success not lack of money per se is what
__label__news what defines and keeps people in poverty last week i was part of a panel at the atlantic s conference on
__label__news on reinventing the war on poverty krugman appeared via video immediately after our panel angela glover blackwell founder and president of
__label__news of policy link made the case for infrastructure generally and broadband in particular as essential to helping people out of poverty
__label__news poverty the moderator then asked me about my argument that it s not the money it s the network blackwell s
__label__news s infrastructure argument was the perfect departure point those in poverty essentially live on a desert island air dropping resources may
__label__news may help in the short term but the real solution is to build bridges the benefits to the larger society of
__label__news of these connections in releasing further economic potential like the explosion of energy that results from bringing critical masses of atoms
__label__news atoms together is the flipside but what about the imf s finding that societies with greater inequality are associated with economic
__label__news economic spurts it s good to recall that we re talking correlations not cause and effect while we ve got an
__label__news an argument that equity causes growth i think the argument here is the reverse that growth spurts are a cause of
__label__news of inequality economic revolutions like those of the industrial or internet ages don t just generate great new wealth they do
__label__news do so unevenly in the process they shatter existing rules and norms including the systems of social insurance whether village life
__label__news life or welfare states that mitigate the vicissitudes inequity is one of the side effects of economic efficiency the argument against
__label__news against accepting such resulting inequities long term is not just moral but economic however if they are allowed to persist eventually
__label__news eventually they stifle further growth for all economic output or gross domestic product gdp shrank in the first quarter even as
__label__news as euro zone gdp swelled by just according to figures from eurostat the eu s statistical unit recovery had appeared to
__label__news to be well under way with the country s economy growing since the second quarter of when portugal had the fastest

__label__news something really weird like you can t fix a problem like underpaid public school teachers by just throwing money at them
__label__news them or why do they need tax funded traffic lights at this corner all the cross traffic s already stopped which
__label__news which shows the free market works or hitler was a communist they called themselves the national socialists for a reason you
__label__news you my friend have just made the unpleasant discovery that you ve been talking to a libertarian now don t get
__label__news get me wrong most smart people are to a certain extent libertarians with a lower case l we all like to
__label__news to be left alone to determine the course of our own lives without state intrusion but capital l libertarians tend to
__label__news to take those admirable sentiments to their logical extreme wanting to shrink fire departments and public libraries and fema down to
__label__news to the size where they can be drowned in grover norquist s bathtub or failing that at least stabbed to death
__label__news death like marat and some of them are smart people despite it all they ve just been sadly misled i blame
__label__news blame the proselytizers who are every bit as creepily efficient as the scientologists if not quite as well regarded by society
__label__news society young people who from time immemorial have had to learn to find their way among varying political philosophies come upon
__label__news upon deceptive political quizzes left laying around on the internet like leg hold traps in a beaver pond designed to lure
__label__news lure the unwary into the clutches of official libertarianism the carefully designed questions display a subtle nearly undetectable bias in favor
__label__news favor of a libertarian point of view complete this sentence that government is best which all the money out of my
__label__news my bank account bludgeons cute little fluffy baby ducks to death governs least all the money out of my bank account
__label__news account and bludgeons cute little fluffy baby ducks to death and after about similar questions designed to pinpoint their opinons mathematically
__label__news mathematically the test takers are told to plot themselves appropriately on a two axis political graph if you land in the
__label__news the shaded area they re told you just might be a libertarian and they get sucked in from there now most
__label__news most new libertarians eventually after repeated contact with reality temper their beliefs this article is not about them the people who
__label__news who concede that some taxes are necessary to pay firefighters who recognize that their success as business people might just depend
__label__news depend on public education to give them a pool of potentially competent employees and so forth these people are fun to
__label__news to argue with over beer once they get past the zealot stage and it s just possible that you might be
__label__news be the person who provides that needed spark of thought who points out that oh i dunno the government they decry
__label__news decry for limiting suburban construction in the old growth forest also paves the roads that make housing developments in other places
__label__news places possible or that their popular free marketeer blog owes its existence to several decades of government funding of arpanet if
__label__news if those don t work sometimes these people are persuaded when it s pointed out to them that back in the
__label__news the late th century the us essentially was the libertarian state they now advocate and a very few people got very
__label__news very wealthy while the rest of us died of food poisoning or coal mine collapses or shirtwaist factory fires or you
__label__news you can just give them a copy of paulina borsook s cyberselfish with repeated exposure to reality over time the rational
__label__news rational libertarian will grant that absolutism is not very useful usually at about the same time they get their learner s
__label__news s permit but there are some libertarians who remain unswayed by such ugly facts whether through persistent ignorance or sociopathy or
__label__news or a mixture of the two they hold as an article of near religious faith that they derive no benefit from
__label__news from the modern regulatory apparatus that they could not duplicate on their own with the homebrew fda they have in their
__label__news their garage or even worse they manifestly hold the welfare of others as far less important than their own profit and
__label__news and comfort as an example of that last witness this notable bay area libertarian a meat packing magnate who did not
__label__news not want the law to see how his sausage was made in a cutthroat economic free for all with the mass
__label__news mass of people on the bottom and a handful of ruthless machiavellian princes at the top each one of these goobers
__label__news goobers thinks it s inevitable that he gender specificity deliberate will inevitably become one of the princes you cannot argue these
__label__news these people into rationality nor can you persuade them by logic to show compassion for their fellow humans the best you
__label__news you can do is to make their heads explode with simple fact based declarative sentences i ve found a few reliable
__label__news reliable ways to do so which i will describe here briefly you might know of others feel free to describe them
__label__news them in comments using these sentences will cause libertarian cultists to sputter stammer and occasionally start to think worst case scenario
__label__news scenario these sentences will usually at least cause them to shut up and it s hard to downplay the importance of
__label__news of that in making your typical day a bit rosier libertarian cranial detonation technique mentioning libertarian history most american libertarians have
__label__news have precious little grasp of the history of their political philosophy they seem to think that the libertarian school of thought
__label__news thought sprang fully formed like athena from ayn rand s beetled brow with robert heinlein as attending midwife libertarianism s true
__label__news true origins however unsettle most libertarians to the point where the mere acceptance of that history often starts those rusty old
__label__news old mental gears grinding again to wit and here is tactical nuclear sentence number one libertarianism originated in the philosophy of
__label__news of a left wing french political philosopher who also influenced karl marx the french philosopher in question is as some of
__label__news of you have guessed and with whose description a few of you are no doubt ready to quibble pierre joseph proudhon
__label__news proudhon who famously penned the libertarians sekrit motto property is theft of course unlike modern libertarians proudhon meant that as a
__label__news a condemnation among the pre marxist political thinkers strongly influenced by proudhon was johann kaspar schmidt who under the pen name
__label__news name max stirner wrote one of the first true capital l libertarian texts der einzige und sein eigentum which can be
__label__news be translated either as the ego and its own or more and more tellingly the individual and his property stirner became
__label__news became a nucleus of a nascent school of political thought then called individualist anarchism whose inheritance tax free heirs include ludwig
__label__news ludwig von mises the austrian and chicago schools murray rothbard alan greenspan and so on libertarian cranial detonation technique mentioning libertarianism
__label__news libertarianism s siblings but proudhon and to a certain extent stirner also influenced a number of political philosophers and activists who
__label__news who extended the anarchist critique of power relations to the economic sphere bakunin tolstoy kropotkin goldman malatesta etc the early twentieth
__label__news twentieth century saw a mass anarchist movement in the industrial world and though that got pretty much squelched the philosophy lived
__label__news lived on to influence much of the modern progressive left despite the libertarians historically illiterate insistence that socialism is synonymous with
__label__news with totalitarianism much of current left thought is libertarian at its root which provides us with the useful sentence i m
__label__news m a libertarian socialist of course it s easier to say that if you actually are one but the definitions of
__label__news of both adjectives are broad enough to encompass a range of people from noam chomsky to paul wellstone in fact the
__label__news the boundary between libertarian socialist and liberal democrat is pretty much impossible to delineate with any kind of precision people who
__label__news who are libertarian socialists in the long view are often liberal democrats in the moment what s the more libertarian way
__label__news way of running the world coming up with ever evolving procedures by which the largest number of people possible have the
__label__news the largest amount of input possible into the policy by which we run the world moderated by recognizing certain expertise and
__label__news and the efficiency of delegating some decision making which is a bright eyed and optimistic way of describing the mission of
__label__news of liberal democracy or letting the people who are best at accumulating money bribe bully and blackmail their way into running
__label__news running huge sections of the world libertarian cranial detonation technique mentioning libertarianism s blindspot that accumulation of serious political power is
__label__news is the end result of the libertarian political wankdream and yet somehow boss based coercion escapes the libertarian scrutiny to which
__label__news which municipal zoning boards and feminist bloggers with itchy banning fingers are routinely subjected look at it this way what would
__label__news would you call a political system that regulates its subjects activities on a minute by minute basis that often requires of
__label__news of its citizens prior restraint on freedom of speech that controls where its subjects go what they wear and who they
__label__news they talk to that restricts online reading material in a beijing style manner that has a rigid hierarchy to enforce edicts
__label__news edicts from the upper echelons and do routine surveillance of the rank and file that denies its subjects privacy even to
__label__news to the point of demanding the right to examine their urine and that punishes infractions by permanent banishment some people would
__label__news would call it a dictatorship but many of us call it the workplace somehow libertarians never seem to object to restrictions
__label__news restrictions of liberty done by the boss you can always get another job they say as if that answers anything as
__label__news as if the class of people who can leave a job blithely isn t the same class that s most likely
__label__news likely to be able to pick up and move away from a conventional state based dictatorship and as corporations extend their
__label__news their control to people outside their employ with drm and increasingly prevalent shameless propaganda and their own armed forces and even
__label__news even co optation of the nominal forms of governmental authority the truth of our next useful sentence becomes ever more manifestly
__label__news manifestly clear that sentence being corporations are governments which is of course the libertarian socialist criticism of libertarianism in soundbite form
__label__news form i ve never known a libertarian to be able to answer that one without changing the subject completely usually to
__label__news to a defense of guantanamo from a libertarian pov at which point they ve been made incapable of influencing anyone who
__label__news who s not a fellow libertarian which means you can get on with your life try it and see and without
__label__news without the soup cans and also without the practicing medicine without a license though the libertarians would defend the scientologists right
__label__news right to practice medicine without a license this is of course known as the renaissance faire fallacy and now called classical
__label__news classical liberalism and you can come up with all kinds of objections to that description i know and i d agree
__label__news agree with most of them give me a damn break this is a polemic not an operator s manual responses to

__label__news pm one of the most annoying people i knew at college was a libertarian he was one of those seven year
__label__news year undergraduates who spent most of his time hanging out at the school paper he occasionally wrote a headline or something
__label__news something but his main function seemed to be arguing with anyone who would listen he would argue the most preposterous points
__label__news points for instance he spent one evening loudly insisting that hitler knew nothing about the holocaust his favorite tactic when cornered
__label__news cornered was to screech i don t know what books you ve read i m sure that by now he s
__label__news s a gs or something comfortably close to a government funded retirement blue jean feb rd at pm i dunno carl
__label__news carl if the night is shining then the damsels wouldn t be in such distress would they tzs feb rd at
__label__news at pm i ve come to the conclusion is a libertarian with the big l is someone who has never had
__label__news had to live in the real world either because he is too young pimply faced year old reading ayn rand or
__label__news or because he is with enough money etc to be shielded from the effects of any of his choices the third
__label__news third category the majority from what i ve seen are computer geeks in their early s who think doom and mad
__label__news mad max are realistic and optimal descriptions of human interactions my way of engaging libertarians minds is to point out that
__label__news that there has never been a society which has not had taxation throughout history either you pay taxes to the gov
__label__news gov t or protection money to the mafia and which would they prefer karpad feb rd at pm honestly i enjoy
__label__news enjoy demonstrative brutal violence as much fun as they have blathering about randian objectivism it basically means we get to use
__label__news use the government to enforce the power we like but all other force isn t faaaair which is why they want
__label__news want cops with guns to prevent people from robbing them but a system rigged where they get rich at others expense
__label__news expense it s legal so it doesn t count they want rigged anarchy and i shall have none of that gimme
__label__news gimme your beer money or i ll crack you in the head with a blunt object it s my will to
__label__news to power that grants me a right to swing my club so you better give me a damn good incentive to
__label__news to take my crowbar and leave either everyone gets a fair shake or no one does stephen feb rd at pm
__label__news pm most hard core movement libertarians are little more than cranks with very little real influence outside of silicon valley but
__label__news but tragically some libertarian memes have creeped into common knowledge these are the worst ones in my opinion the problem with
__label__news with schools is the teachers union we should privatize x because the government is inefficient social security is broken because i
__label__news i could do better investing the money myself regulation always causes problems people want to go on welfare the first pisses
__label__news pisses me off because everyone believes it it drives me insane as if all those broken inner city schools have qualified
__label__news qualified candidates breaking down the door to make k sarah in chicago feb rd at pm if those don t work
__label__news work sometimes these people are persuaded when it s pointed out to them that back in the late th century the
__label__news the us essentially was the libertarian state they now advocate and a very few people got very wealthy while the rest
__label__news rest of us died of food poisoning or coal mine collapses or shirtwaist factory fires thank you i get really annoyed
__label__news annoyed by libertarians that rave on about the evils of government and just want one try in order to prove that
__label__news that what they are suggesting will actually work when you point out it s been tried a few times in history
__label__news history and the results were horrible and we re not speaking mildly annoying here we re talking collapse of society horrible
__label__news horrible it basically comes down for me to the point of who would you rather have looking out for your best
__label__news best interests and those of minorities a company whose bottom line is intrinsically profit or government that is technically by the
__label__news the people for the people i mean the latter might be a tad ideal but it still stands and is fairly
__label__news fairly self evident the better solution as a snark my personal fav of the insanely funny morons are the christian conservative
__label__news conservative theocratic libertarians it s kinda like the mutant child of a porcupine and a spider crab having you wince merely
__label__news merely at the thought elinor feb rd at pm i am going to use the phrase renaissance faire fallacy as many
__label__news many times as possible in the next week or so awesome i cannot remember how many times i ve had to
__label__news to tell people pining for the days of nights in shining and damsels in distress that they wouldn t be either
__label__news either that statistically they d be the peasant living in extreme poverty and dying in their s white people who speak
__label__news speak with dreamy appreciation of the confederacy in particular and the antebellum south in general seem to have the same kind
__label__news kind of fantasies in my experience as do randroids although the fantasies are a little different they tend to think extremely
__label__news extremely highly of their own abilities and have thoroughgoing contempt for everybody else lyle feb rd at pm what was it
__label__news it libertarians are really just republicans with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder someone posted a link to the libertarian faq the other
__label__news other day and that was on it thought it was very descriptive aeroman feb rd at pm if you just mention

__label__news excellent suggestions for dealing with the individual examples but what if you stumble into a nest of the beasts if you
__label__news you are ganged up on by libertarians the best thing to do is just remain silent they ll quickly start disagreeing
__label__news disagreeing on what true libertarians should believe then the anarcho capitalists will gang up on the synicalists and you can just
__label__news just call in the disposal squad if you want to help it along you can start it off by asking innocently
__label__news innocently if hayek can be reconciled with rand just be prepared to duck utsusemi feb rd at pm carl rennie that
__label__news that was my first clue that maybe my first college boyfriend was not somebody i wanted to stick around for long

__label__news each one of these goobers thinks it s inevitable that he gender specificity deliberate will inevitably become one of the princes
__label__news princes libertarians certainly do not see themselves as one of the princes that would imply that they control others one of
__label__news of the fundamental beliefs of libertarianism is that in order to be free from the controls of others you must be
__label__news be willing to give up your claims to control others i think more of you all fall into that trap you
__label__news you think that an all powerful government can work as long as the right people are in power and when you
__label__news you say right people you mean yourselves back in the late th century the us essentially was the libertarian state they
__label__news they now advocate living in the late th century sucked ass compared to the way we live today but it should
__label__news should be noted that living in the us was better than living anywhere else really i have no idea if libertarianism
__label__news libertarianism would work in the st century that is why i support the system the framers envisioned a weak federal government
__label__news government with states as individual test tubes of economic systems new hampshire and wyoming could become libertarian massachusetts socialist and the
__label__news the lifestyle that people prefer would become evident pretty quickly carl rennie feb rd at pm tzs said i ve come
__label__news come to the conclusion is a libertarian with the big l is someone who has never had to live in the
__label__news the real world either because he is too young pimply faced year old reading ayn rand or because he is with
__label__news with enough money etc to be shielded from the effects of any of his choices my experience is similar but the
__label__news the defining factor seems to be less their own circumstances than a lack of empathy and a blindness to privilege especially
__label__news especially structural i ve seen kids whose parents put them through good high schools expensive after school programs and expensive colleges
__label__news colleges where they had their room and board books and tuition fully paid for claim that they got where they were
__label__news were entirely on their own merit they have a hard time imagining that someone without those privileges would find it more
__label__news more difficult to achieve on the same level libertarians often deny that structural barriers to success even exist and it s
__label__news s mostly because they haven t encountered them i had one person argue with a straight face that a ceo really

__label__news to use it the very next time i argue with someone about americans for tax reform and watch the wingnut stumble
__label__news stumble around trying to remember his european history classes not that i probably need to point folks around here to pz
__label__news pz s place but this is one of the funniest things i ve ever read i think everyone meets one of
__label__news of these guys i say guys advisedly in my experience they re almost universally male at some point my libertarian crank
__label__news crank cherry was broken by the vp of the forensics club in college who like bitter scribe s acquaintance was a
__label__news a perpetual undergrad he was majoring in political science and international relations and was frustrated that no one wanted to listen
__label__news listen to his theories on how china could never be a real economic threat to the us the second one i
__label__news i met was a coworker a couple of years ago he was an otherwise sane flash director programmer who idolized not
__label__news not ayn rand but neal boortz he actually said to me once in a heated argument about social safety nets that
__label__news that if you can t afford to buy food you deserve to starve j swift feb rd at pm my snarky
__label__news snarky off the cuff previously typed definition of libertarians people who talk about the ideals of freedom but at the end
__label__news end of the day can t keep their fucking hands to themselves sarah in chicago feb rd at pm libertarians often
__label__news often deny that structural barriers to success even exist and it s mostly because they haven t encountered them nods ditto
__label__news ditto on that carl i ve seriously had a libertarian tell me that society doesn t really exist that there is
__label__news is no social cultural structural system in place and that we are merely a collection of individuals his evidence he s
__label__news s never seen a society did i mention he was a white straight guy i just sat there with my mouth
__label__news mouth open and then left it was pointless to go any further would be to cross over and get pulled into
__label__news into that singularity of insanity carl rennie feb rd at pm utsusemi said carl rennie that was my first clue that
__label__news that maybe my first college boyfriend was not somebody i wanted to stick around for long his confused indifference when i
__label__news i mentioned that his pre post technological fantasyland would be maybe not so fun for the women in his life was
__label__news was clue i know i long for the days when men were men and women all wore tight bodices and spoke
__label__news spoke in faux olde englishe i also have a strange craving for mead rob g feb rd at pm why on
__label__news on earth would you want to engage in discourse with these people i ve found that go away works fairly well
__label__news well if said in the right tone of voice bunbun vonwhiskers feb rd at pm over at the jref politics forum
__label__news forum i frequent they have a lot of intelligent people of different political stripes they also have a capital l libertarian
__label__news libertarian who basically believes that everything is the fault of the government and if the government were to be shrunk to
__label__news to practically nothing civilization would achieve utopia you can t really change his mind on these things but trying to reason
__label__news reason with him can be an interesting journey into the world of behavioral psychology the scary thing is the number of
__label__news of his posts you can read that sound perfectly rational reasonable and well thought out before you hit nuttiness well reasoned
__label__news reasoned posts about privacy and government intrusion will then devolve into rants about how states have the legal right to secede
__label__news secede and the evil of coming off the gold standard and what is really frightning to me is that this guy
__label__news guy votes chris clarke feb rd at pm my libertarian crank cherry was broken by the vp of the forensics club
__label__news club in college q how do you know if a person is a libertarian crank virgin a if their hayek is
__label__news is intact rob g feb rd at pm i ve seriously had a libertarian tell me that society doesn t really

__label__news asshole there are always assholes who will game the system and libertarian markets don t punish them they reward them e
__label__news e g lee raymond dick cheney ken lay et al shorter libertarian dogma fuck the poor they deserve their fate in
__label__news in order to believe in libertarian dogma you have to believe that all rich people are fundamentally superior to all poor
__label__news poor people and proportionately along the spectrum as well this means libertarians have to stipulate that britney spears is smarter richer
__label__news richer than them and high school science teachers are the moral inferiors of larry flynt tzs feb rd at pm plus
__label__news plus the fact that a real libertarian society wouldn t last more than one generation if that much as has been
__label__news been pointed out by people much wiser than i you re not going to have very many people raising children child
__label__news child raising is totally the opposite to any ideal put out by ayn rand dumbing us down to see why and
__label__news and because that s all the nea wants they are a big part of the problem a new approach needs to
__label__news to be created one that allows many possible choices for education one that is not controlled by the government though funded
__label__news funded by them if you take a history of education class you ll quickly realize that our current factory style school
__label__news school system was created to make complacent controllable workers that in my not so humble opinion is deeply deeply wrong and
__label__news and now we re having our little workers learning how to do nothing but take tests and certainly not teaching them
__label__news them critical thinking or decent history for the record i m female and a history student the marines were sent into
__label__news into nicaragua to make that country safe for united fruit this is inappropriate and would never occur under a libertarian regime
__label__news regime corporations are governments how did this happen this was the result of a thoroughly ridiculous supreme court decision getting corporations
__label__news corporations back to the original intent a state charter for limited purposes and durations subject to review by state gov t
__label__news t s would put a stop to this corruption any corporation that attempted that could be dissolved as being against the
__label__news the public interest sometimes these people are persuaded when it s pointed out to them that back in the late th
__label__news th century the us essentially was the libertarian state they now advocate and a very few people got very wealthy while
__label__news while the rest of us died of food poisoning or coal mine collapses or shirtwaist factory fires ok fine however technology
__label__news technology wasn t as advanced in those days and a late th century factory was a nasty noisey dangerous place to
__label__news to work as bad as it was it sure did beat subsistance farming by a very large margin let us also
__label__news also not forget that those early factory workers were the seed of an up and coming middle class some few did
__label__news did get mega wealthy the jobs moved from the land of freedom to communist china and socialist india yep turns out
__label__news out all corporations really want is cheap cheap labor most of these arrogant fucks lost their jobs and so did i
__label__news i between and they weren t so mouthy after their jobs got offshored economic freedom to constrain those with resources from
__label__news from abusing their influence and very moderately to minimally limiting social freedom only in the furtherance of that goal that s
__label__news s the party platform and has been for decades now if you are a republican you should truly believe in limiting
__label__news limiting social freedom to maintain a traditionally moral society and only limiting economic freedom to facilitate limiting social freedom libertarian philosophy
__label__news philosophy of maximum economic and social freedom stalin lenin mao and pol pot and their enormous body counts were a part
__label__news part of the democrat s ideological legacy working for one huge monopoly on working conditions wages etc that s great as
__label__news as long as the great beneficent democratic party holds power what about when they lose an election after all majority rules
__label__news rules right so when the fascists get voted in and have all the gays fired well that s just democracy in
__label__news in action right stable enough to be a realistic social economic system we ve seen some pretty crazy set ups already
__label__news already from calvin s geneva to israeli kibbutzim to soviet era communism to s housewife breadwinner to present day people living
__label__news living in the wilderness notice that none of them last that long heck the s housewife breadwinner setup didn t even
__label__news even last years as shown by the rebellions megacorps have megalawyers so they can just suck it up knowing that despite
__label__news despite the hassle they still benefit from having upstart competitors driven out of business it is quite possible to obtain desired
__label__news desired outcomes without overly burdensome regulation at least in many cases but it won t happen unless progressives start caring about
__label__news about minimizing burdens as well as managing externalities philboo feb th at pm the money google up funding for the cato
__label__news cato institute then you begin to understand the libertarians cesar feb th at pm tzs what is liberalism what is conservatism
__label__news conservatism what is marxism every ideology is going to have disagreements within it capitalism but not a free market so one
__label__news one of the challenges facing anyone trying to set up a workable middle path state is extricating current private business from
__label__news from the privileges they ve been receiving from the state many libertarians decry the excesses of corporations when the government is
__label__news is collusionary in those excesses many libertarians are upset about kelo v new london not because the government forced people to
__label__news to sell their land but that they did so to benefit a large corporate interest that s not to say that
__label__news that if new london were taking that land to build a swanky new city hall that libertarians would be pleased they
__label__news they d undoubtedly oppose it but the honest ones would concede that it was legal and constitutional american corporate governance to
__label__news to eliminate the perverse incentives for ceos and boards of directors to increase each others compensation we who is we why
__label__news why should i care what some ceo makes or doesn t make in a private or public corporation that is not
__label__news not my business unless of course i own stock in the corporation perverse incentives who judges what is perverse marx incorrectly
__label__news incorrectly applied the term capitalism to corporatism and mercantilism other than that he was entirely correct in his critique corporate governance
__label__news governance rules and boards need to be more accountable by being easier to unseat no more staggered boards for example see
__label__news see some of the books on the topic for more detailed proposals ayn rand school the epa right and a nice
__label__news nice national health system anti terrorism umbrella a wealth tax which has been around for some time colette had an essay
__label__news essay on this in an issue of vogue way back when unfortunately never been translated as far as i know the
__label__news the problem with sales taxes vat taxes etc is that they are horribly regressive a rich person ends up paying far
__label__news far less of a percentage of his income in taxes than a poor person unless you tax only things which people
__label__news people who are better off buy which if you consider how much more protection a rich person theoretically gets from the
__label__news the gov t property protection means he s a free rider not good of government regulation would be coming down the
__label__news the pipe to mitigate cue the cognitive dissonance and conspiracy theories generally believes government is inefficient and should be run more
__label__news more like worldcom arthur andersen and tyco mourned augusto pinochet s indictment house arrest disgrace and death because you know while
__label__news while he did kill a few thousand people he did make the economy hum along jolly good rants about america s
__label__news s high taxes as compared to well there s uh er never mind invested heavily in enron as proof of market
__label__news market based mechanisms born wealthy honoring that talent is plutocracy at best and aristocracy at worst not the meritocracy that libertarians
__label__news libertarians usually claim to prefer a libertarian is someone who screams bloody murder when government violates his rights with seat belt
__label__news belt laws and mild gun restrictions but is not too concerned when government kidnaps detains tortures and occasionally murders little brown
__label__news brown people from overseas liberterians are anti interventionism they see it a waste of lives and resources to send troops overseas
__label__news overseas for a war that is not done for the purpose of self defense needs software to inventory his gun collection
__label__news collection thank god i ll only use it for either self defense or entertainment uses government funded arpanet to discuss government
__label__news government incompetence we re on the internet not the arpanet the fact that the commercial internet has slightly more staying power
__label__news power than it s goverment funded predecessor should stand for something claims climate change is unproven because if it were proven
__label__news proven then a hell of a lot of government regulation would be coming down the pipe to mitigate cue the cognitive
__label__news cognitive dissonance and conspiracy theories their is a consensus among scientists that global warming is happening and that it is caused
__label__news caused by emmisions there is not a consensous however that we should abandon all economic freedoms in order to have that
__label__news that happen the goverment completely wasted something like million to make the failure that was the ev not to mention what
__label__news what would happen to third world countires when we tell them that we would have to tell them that their fledging
__label__news fledging industries would now have to become even more fledgin generally believes government is inefficient and should be run more like
__label__news like worldcom arthur andersen and tyco mourned augusto pinochet s indictment house arrest disgrace and death because you know while he
__label__news he did kill a few thousand people he did make the economy hum along jolly good pinochet made great progess on
__label__news on economic freedoms but his track record on personal freedoms where so appalling that he deserved a lot worse than what
__label__news what he got rants about america s high taxes as compared to well there s uh er never mind the tallest
__label__news tallest dwarf invested heavily in enron as proof of market based mechanisms heh heh heh heh sucker no i didn t
__label__news t cesar feb th at pm nick wow you are really really full of shit if you think libertarians don t
__label__news t oppose this war and the constitutional violations this president has committed many libertarians in fact voted for democrats in the
__label__news the last congressional elections because of the putrid excesses of the past six years most oppose the war in iraq guantanamo
__label__news guantanamo bay the suspension of habeus corpus and the intimidation of the the legislative branch fortunatley we had those brave liberal
__label__news liberal democrats in the senate back in to filibuster the war resolution l out poverty oh wait that s too simple
__label__news simple that can t possibly be mourned augusto pinochet s indictment house arrest disgrace and death because you know while he
__label__news he did kill a few thousand people he did make the economy hum along jolly good chile s economy did improve
__label__news improve under pinochet which doesn t change the fact that he murdered quite a few of his own citizens that said
__label__news said in the grand scheme of things i m a bit more worried about governments like the ussr china north korea
__label__news korea and cambodia that killed tens of millions of people and destroyed their economies at the same time rants about america
__label__news america s high taxes as compared to well there s uh er never mind well since i don t pay taxes
__label__news taxes in germany and i do pay taxes in the us i think i ll worry about taxes here and their
__label__news their affect on the poor and vulnerable invested heavily in enron as proof of market based mechanisms a corporation is a
__label__news a state created entity true but the only purpose of that categorization is to define how the state treats it the
__label__news the corporation receives no succor from the state that it couldn t obtain without it in a world without corporations ceo
__label__news ceo s or their equivalent by any other name would still exist and do productive activities yes people ceos usually do
__label__news do those things believe it or not i fail to see your point i was addressing the comment that two thousand
__label__news thousand janitors would somehow be incapable of producing as much as one ceo political opinions do not depend on whether the
__label__news the steam engine and the automatic loom has been developed or not are you honestly claiming that the advent of the
__label__news the mass media the enormous shift of the population into cities the move from self sustaining farms to the family wage
__label__news wage the development of industrial warfare and all the other developments of the last two centuries were so insignificant as to
__label__news to have no notable effect on the polity i take it that you agree that there has been no successful large
__label__news large scale attempt at making left anarchism workable without such excesses are mass murder uh are you sure you want to
__label__news to go down that route i mean all i was trying to point out was that the spanish civil war featured
__label__news featured just a few more participants than left libertarians i really didn t expect a goddamn libertarian to try and use
__label__news use the existing socialism gambit i mean your track record is no better and your own rhetoric explains the reason libertarian
__label__news libertarian movements tend to be put down with bullets batons and gas wielded by authoritarians of both public and private types
__label__news types grokked feb th at am i can grok the stereotype i have met him in the flesh yet libertarians themselves
__label__news themselves civil rights abuses check big government with special favors for the powerful check if liberals really were liberal you know
__label__news know like libertarians who actually are social and economic liberals foreign policy in focus www fpif org noam chomsky is a
__label__news a noted linguist author and foreign policy expert on february michael shank interviewed him on the latest developments in u s
__label__news s policy toward iran iraq north korea and venezuela along the way chomsky also commented on climate change the world social
__label__news social forum and why international relations are run like the mafia shank with similar nuclear developments in north korea and iran
__label__news iran why has the united states pursued direct diplomacy with north korea but refuses to do so with iran chomsky to
__label__news to say that the united states has pursued diplomacy with north korea is a little bit misleading it did under the
__label__news the clinton administration though neither side completely lived up to their obligations clinton didn t do what was promised nor did
__label__news did north korea but they were making progress so when bush came into the presidency north korea had enough uranium or
__label__news or plutonium for maybe one or two bombs but then very limited missile capacity during the bush years it s exploded
__label__news exploded the reason is he immediately canceled the diplomacy and he s pretty much blocked it ever since they made a
__label__news a very substantial agreement in september in which north korea agreed to eliminate its enrichment programs and nuclear development completely in
__label__news in return the united states agreed to terminate the threats of attack and to begin moving towards the planning for the
__label__news the provision of a light water reactor which had been promised under the framework agreement but the bush administration instantly undermined
__label__news undermined it right away they canceled the international consortium that was planning for the light water reactor which was a way
__label__news way of saying we re not going to agree to this agreement a couple of days later they started attacking the
__label__news the financial transactions of various banks it was timed in such a way to make it clear that the united states
__label__news states was not going to move towards its commitment to improve relations and of course it never withdrew the threats so
__label__news so that was the end of the september agreement that one is now coming back just in the last few days
__label__news days the way it s portrayed in the u s media is as usual with the government s party line that
__label__news that north korea is now perhaps a little more amenable to accept the september proposal so there s some optimism if
__label__news if you go across the atlantic to the financial times to review the same events they point out that an embattled
__label__news embattled bush administration it s their phrase needs some kind of victory so maybe it ll be willing to move towards
__label__news towards diplomacy it s a little more accurate i think if you look at the background but there is some minimal
__label__news minimal sense of optimism about it if you look back over the record mdash and north korea is a horrible place
__label__news place nobody is arguing about that mdash on this issue they ve been pretty rational it s been a kind of
__label__news of tit for tat history if the united states is accommodating the north koreans become accommodating if the united states is
__label__news is hostile they become hostile that s reviewed pretty well by leon sigal who s one of the leading specialists on
__label__news on this in a recent issue of current history but that s been the general picture and we re now at
__label__news at a place where there could be a settlement on north korea that s much less significant for the united states
__label__news states than iran the iranian issue i don t think has much to do with nuclear weapons frankly nobody is saying
__label__news saying iran should have nuclear weapons ndash nor should anybody else but the point in the middle east as distinct from
__label__news from north korea is that this is center of the world s energy resources originally the british and secondarily the french
__label__news french had dominated it but after the second world war it s been a u s preserve that s been an
__label__news an axiom of u s foreign policy that it must control middle east energy resources it is not a matter of
__label__news of access as people often say once the oil is on the seas it goes anywhere in fact if the united
__label__news united states used no middle east oil it d have the same policies if we went on solar energy tomorrow it
__label__news it d keep the same policies just look at the internal record or the logic of it the issue has always
__label__news always been control control is the source of strategic power dick cheney declared in kazakhstan or somewhere that control over pipeline
__label__news pipeline is a ldquo tool of intimidation and blackmail rdquo when we have control over the pipelines it s a tool
__label__news tool of benevolence if other countries have control over the sources of energy and the distribution of energy then it is
__label__news is a tool of intimidation and blackmail exactly as cheney said and that s been understood as far back as george
__label__news george kennan and the early post war days when he pointed out that if the united states controls middle east resources
__label__news resources it ll have veto power over its industrial rivals he was speaking particularly of japan but the point generalizes so
__label__news so iran is a different situation it s part of the major energy system of the world shank so when the
__label__news the united states considers a potential invasion you think it s under the premise of gaining control that is what the
__label__news the united states will gain from attacking iran chomsky there are several issues in the case of iran one is simply
__label__news simply that it is independent and independence is not tolerated sometimes it s called successful defiance in the internal record take
__label__news take cuba a very large majority of the u s population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with cuba and
__label__news and has been for a long time with some fluctuations and even part of the business world is in favor of
__label__news of it too but the government won t allow it it s attributed to the florida vote but i don t
__label__news t think that s much of an explanation i think it has to do with a feature of world affairs that
__label__news that is insufficiently appreciated international affairs is very much run like the mafia the godfather does not accept disobedience even from
__label__news from a small storekeeper who doesn t pay his protection money you have to have obedience otherwise the idea can spread
__label__news spread that you don t have to listen to the orders and it can spread to important places if you look
__label__news look back at the record what was the main reason for the u s attack on vietnam independent development can be
__label__news be a virus that can infect others that s the way it s been put kissinger in this case referring to
__label__news to allende in chile and with cuba it s explicit in the internal record arthur schlesinger presenting the report of the
__label__news the latin american study group to incoming president kennedy wrote that the danger is the spread of the castro idea of
__label__news of taking matters into your own hands which has a lot of appeal to others in the same region that suffer
__label__news suffer from the same problems later internal documents charged cuba with successful defiance of u s policies going back years ndash
__label__news ndash to the monroe doctrine and that can t be tolerated so there s kind of a state commitment to ensuring
__label__news ensuring obedience going back to iran it s not only that it has substantial resources and that it s part of
__label__news of the world s major energy system but it also defied the united states the united states as we know overthrew
__label__news overthrew the parliamentary government installed a brutal tyrant was helping him develop nuclear power in fact the very same programs that
__label__news that are now considered a threat were being sponsored by the u s government by cheney wolfowitz kissinger and others in
__label__news in the s as long as the shah was in power but then the iranians overthrew him and they kept u
__label__news u s hostages for several hundred days and the united states immediately turned to supporting saddam hussein and his war against
__label__news against iran as a way of punishing iran the united states is going to continue to punish iran because of its
__label__news its defiance so that s a separate factor and again the will of the u s population and even us business
__label__news business is considered mostly irrelevant seventy five percent of the population here favors improving relations with iran instead of threats but
__label__news but this is disregarded we don t have polls from the business world but it s pretty clear that the energy
__label__news energy corporations would be quite happy to be given authorization to go back into iran instead of leaving all that to
__label__news to their rivals but the state won t allow it and it is setting up confrontations right now very explicitly part
__label__news part of the reason is strategic geo political economic but part of the reason is the mafia complex they have to
__label__news to be punished for disobeying us shank venezuela has been successfully defiant with chavez making a swing towards socialism where are
__label__news are they on our list chomsky they re very high the united states sponsored and supported a military coup to overthrow
__label__news overthrow the government in fact that s its last most recent effort in what used to be a conventional resort to
__label__news to such measures shank but why haven t we turned our sights more toward venezuela chomsky oh they re there there
__label__news there s a constant stream of abuse and attack by the government and therefore the media who are almost reflexively against
__label__news against venezuela for several reasons venezuela is independent it s diversifying its exports to a limited extent instead of just being
__label__news being dependent on exports to the united states and it s initiating moves toward latin american integration and independence it s
__label__news s what they call a bolivarian alternative and the united states doesn t like any of that this again is defiance
__label__news defiance of u s policies going back to the monroe doctrine there s now a standard interpretation of this trend in
__label__news in latin america another kind of party line latin america is all moving to the left from venezuela to argentina with
__label__news with rare exceptions but there s a good left and a bad left the good left is garcia and lula and
__label__news and then there s the bad left which is chavez morales maybe correa and that s the split in order to
__label__news to maintain that position it s necessary to resort to some fancy footwork for example it s necessary not to report
__label__news report the fact that when lula was re elected in october his foreign trip and one of his first acts was
__label__news was to visit caracas to support chavez and his electoral campaign and to dedicate a joint venezuelan brazilian project on the
__label__news the orinoco river to talk about new projects and so on it s necessary not to report the fact that a
__label__news a couple of weeks later in cochabamba bolivia which is the heart of the bad guys there was a meeting of
__label__news of all south american leaders there had been bad blood between chavez and garcia but it was apparently patched up they
__label__news they laid plans for pretty constructive south american integration but that just doesn t fit the u s agenda so it
__label__news it wasn t reported shank how is the political deadlock in lebanon impacting the u s government s decision to potentially
__label__news potentially go to war with iran is there a relationship at all chomsky there s a relationship i presume part of
__label__news of the reason for the u s israel invasion of lebanon in july mdash and it is us israeli the lebanese
__label__news lebanese are correct in calling it that mdash part of the reason i suppose was that hezbollah is considered a deterrent
__label__news deterrent to a potential u s israeli attack on iran it had a deterrent capacity i e rockets and the goal
__label__news goal i presume was to wipe out the deterrent so as to free up the united states and israel for an
__label__news an eventual attack on iran that s at least part of the reason the official reason given for the invasion can
__label__news can t be taken seriously for a moment that s the capture of two israeli soldiers and the killing of a
__label__news a couple others for decades israel has been capturing and kidnapping lebanese and palestinian refugees on the high seas from cyprus
__label__news cyprus to lebanon killing them in lebanon bringing them to israel holding them as hostages it s been going on for
__label__news for decades has anybody called for an invasion of israel of course israel doesn t want any competition in the region
__label__news region but there s no principled basis for the massive attack on lebanon which was horrendous in fact one of the
__label__news the last acts of the u s israeli invasion right after the ceasefire was announced before it was implemented was to
__label__news to saturate much of the south with cluster bombs there s no military purpose for that the war was over the
__label__news the ceasefire was coming un de mining groups that are working there say that the scale is unprecedented it s much
__label__news much worse than any other place they ve worked kosovo afghanistan iraq anywhere there are supposed to be about one million
__label__news million bomblets left there a large percentage of them don t explode until you pick them up a child picks them
__label__news them up or a farmer hits it with a hoe or something so what it does basically is make the south
__label__news south uninhabitable until the mining teams for which the united states and israel don t contribute clean it up this is
__label__news is arable land it means that farmers can t go back it means that it may undermine a potential hezbollah deterrent
__label__news deterrent they apparently have pretty much withdrawn from the south according to the un you can t mention hezbollah in the
__label__news the u s media without putting in the context of ldquo iranian supported hezbollah rdquo that s its name its name
__label__news name is iranian supported hezbollah it gets iranian support but you can mention israel without saying us supported israel so this
__label__news this is more tacit propaganda the idea that hezbollah is acting as an agent of iran is very dubious it s
__label__news s not accepted by specialists on iran or specialists on hezbollah but it s the party line or sometimes you can
__label__news can put in syria i e ldquo syrian supported hezbollah rdquo but since syria is of less interest now you have
__label__news have to emphasize iranian support shank how can the u s government think an attack on iran is feasible given troop
__label__news troop availability troop capacity and public sentiment chomsky as far as i m aware the military in the united states thinks
__label__news thinks it s crazy and from whatever leaks we have from intelligence the intelligence community thinks it s outlandish but not
__label__news not impossible if you look at people who have really been involved in the pentagon s strategic planning for years people
__label__news people like sam gardiner they point out that there are things that possibly could be done i don t think any
__label__news any of the outside commentators at least as far as i m aware have taken very seriously the idea of bombing
__label__news bombing nuclear facilities they say if there will be bombing it ll be carpet bombing so get the nuclear facilities but
__label__news but get the rest of the country too with an exception by accident of geography the world s major oil resources
__label__news resources are in shi ite dominated areas iran s oil is concentrated right near the gulf which happens to be an
__label__news an arab area not persian khuzestan is arab has been loyal to iran fought with iran not iraq during the iran
__label__news iran iraq war this is a potential source of dissension i would be amazed if there isn t an attempt going
__label__news going on to stir up secessionist elements in khuzestan u s forces right across the border in iraq including the surge
__label__news surge are available potentially to ldquo defend rdquo an independent khuzestan against iran which is the way it would be put
__label__news put if they can carry it off shank do you think that s what the surge was for chomsky that s
__label__news s one possibility there was a release of a pentagon war gaming report in december with gardiner leading it it was
__label__news was released and published in the atlantic ly they couldn t come up with a proposal that didn t lead to
__label__news to disaster but one of the things they considered was maintaining troop presence in iraq beyond what s to be used
__label__news used in iraq for troop replacement and so on and use them for a potential land move in iran presumably khuzestan
__label__news khuzestan where the oil is if you could carry that off you could just bomb the rest of the country to
__label__news to dust again i would be amazed if there aren t efforts to sponsor secessionist movements elsewhere among the azeri population
__label__news population for example it s a very complex ethnic mix in iran much of the population isn t persian there are
__label__news are secessionist tendencies anyway and almost certainly without knowing any of the facts the united states is trying to stir them
__label__news them up to break the country internally if possible the strategy appears to be try to break the country up internally
__label__news internally try to impel the leadership to be as harsh and brutal as possible that s the immediate consequence of constant
__label__news constant threats everyone knows that that s one of the reasons the reformists shirin ebadi and akbar ganji and others are
__label__news are bitterly complaining about the u s threats that it s undermining their efforts to reform and democratize iran but that
__label__news that s presumably its purpose since it s an obvious consequence you have to assume it s the purpose just like
__label__news like in law anticipated consequences are taken as the evidence for intention and here s it so obvious you can t
__label__news t seriously doubt it so it could be that one strain of the policy is to stir up secessionist movements particularly
__label__news particularly in the oil rich regions the arab regions near the gulf also the azeri regions and others second is to
__label__news to try to get the leadership to be as brutal and harsh and repressive as possible to stir up internal disorder
__label__news disorder and maybe resistance and a third is to try to pressure other countries and europe is the most amenable to
__label__news to join efforts to strangle iran economically europe is kind of dragging its feet but they usually go along with the
__label__news the united states the efforts to intensify the harshness of the regime show up in many ways for example the west
__label__news west absolutely adores ahmadinejad any wild statement that he comes out with immediately gets circulated in headlines and mistranslated they love
__label__news love him but anybody who knows anything about iran presumably the editorial offices knows that he doesn t have anything to
__label__news to do with foreign policy foreign policy is in the hands of his superior the supreme leader khamenei but they don
__label__news don t report his statements particularly when his statements are pretty conciliatory for example they love when ahmadinejad says that israel
__label__news israel shouldn t exist but they don t like it when khamenei right afterwards says that iran supports the arab league
__label__news league position on israel palestine as far as i m aware it never got reported actually you could find khamenei s
__label__news s more conciliatory positions in the financial times but not here and it s repeated by iranian diplomats but that s
__label__news s no good the arab league proposal calls for normalization of relations with israel if it accepts the international consensus of
__label__news of the two state settlement which has been blocked by the united states and israel for thirty years and that s
__label__news s not a good story so it s either not mentioned or it s hidden somewhere it s very hard to
__label__news to predict the bush administration today because they re deeply irrational they were irrational to start with but now they re
__label__news re desperate they have created an unimaginable catastrophe in iraq this should ve been one of the easiest military occupations in
__label__news in history and they succeeded in turning it into one of the worst military disasters in history they can t control
__label__news control it and it s almost impossible for them to get out for reasons you can t discuss in the united
__label__news united states because to discuss the reasons why they can t get out would be to concede the reasons why they
__label__news they invaded we re supposed to believe that oil had nothing to do with it that if iraq were exporting pickles
__label__news pickles or jelly and the center of world oil production were in the south pacific that the united states would ve
__label__news ve liberated them anyway it has nothing to do with the oil what a crass idea anyone with their head screwed
__label__news screwed on knows that that can t be true allowing an independent and sovereign iraq could be a nightmare for the
__label__news the united states it would mean that it would be shi ite dominated at least if it s minimally democratic it
__label__news it would continue to improve relations with iran just what the united states doesn t want to see and beyond that
__label__news that right across the border in saudi arabia where most of saudi oil is there happens to be a large shi
__label__news shi ite population probably a majority moves toward sovereignty in iraq stimulate pressures first for human rights among the bitterly repressed
__label__news repressed shi ite population but also toward some degree of autonomy you can imagine a kind of a loose shi ite
__label__news ite alliance in iraq saudi arabia and iran controlling most of the world s oil and independent of the united states
__label__news states and much worse although europe can be intimidated by the united states china can t it s one of the
__label__news the reasons the main reasons why china is considered a threat we re back to the mafia principle china has been
__label__news been there for years has contempt for the barbarians is overcoming a century of domination and simply moves on its own
__label__news own it does not get intimidated when uncle sam shakes his fist that s scary in particular it s dangerous in
__label__news in the case of the middle east china is the center of the asian energy security grid which includes the central
__label__news central asian states and russia india is also hovering around the edge south korea is involved and iran is an associate
__label__news associate member of some kind if the middle east oil resources around the gulf which are the main ones in the
__label__news the world if they link up to the asian grid the united states is really a second rate power a lot
__label__news lot is at stake in not withdrawing from iraq i m sure that these issues are discussed in internal planning it
__label__news it s inconceivable that they can t think of this but it s out of public discussion it s not in
__label__news in the media it s not in the journals it s not in the baker hamilton report and i think you
__label__news you can understand the reason to bring up these issues would open the question why the united states and britain invaded
__label__news invaded and that question is taboo it s a principle that anything our leaders do is for noble reasons it may
__label__news may be mistaken it may be ugly but basically noble and if you bring in normal moderate conservative strategic economic objectives
__label__news objectives you threatening that principle it s remarkable the extent to which it s held so the original pretexts for the
__label__news the invasion were weapons of mass destruction and ties to al qaida that nobody but maybe wolfowitz or cheney took seriously
__label__news seriously the single question as they kept reiterating in the leadership was will saddam give up his programs of weapons of
__label__news of mass destruction the single question was answered a couple of s later the wrong way and quickly the party line
__label__news line shifted in november bush announced his freedom agenda our real goal is to bring democracy to iraq to transform the
__label__news the middle east that became the party line instantly but it s a mistake to pick out individuals because it s
__label__news s close to universal even in scholarship in fact you can even find scholarly articles that begin by giving the evidence
__label__news evidence that it s complete farce but nevertheless accept it there was a pretty good study of the freedom agenda in
__label__news in current history by two scholars and they give the facts they point out that the freedom agenda was announced on
__label__news on november after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction but the freedom agenda is real even if there s
__label__news s no evidence for it in fact if you look at our policies they re the opposite take palestine there was
__label__news was a free election in palestine but it came out the wrong way so instantly the united states and israel with
__label__news with europe tagging along moved to punish the palestinian people and punish them harshly because they voted the wrong way in
__label__news in a free election that s accepted here in the west as perfectly normal that illustrates the deep hatred and contempt
__label__news contempt for democracy among western elites so deep seated they can t even perceive it when it s in front of
__label__news of their eyes you punish people severely if they vote the wrong way in a free election there s a pretext
__label__news pretext for that too repeated every day hamas must agree to first recognize israel second to end all violence third to
__label__news to accept past agreements try to find a mention of the fact that the united states and israel reject all three
__label__news three of those they obviously don t recognize palestine they certainly don t withdraw the use of violence or the threat
__label__news threat of it in fact they insist on it and they don t accept past agreements including the road map i
__label__news i suspect one of the reasons why jimmy carter s book has come under such fierce attack is because it s
__label__news s the first time i think in the mainstream that one can find the truth about the road map i have
__label__news have never seen anything in the mainstream that discusses the fact that israel instantly rejected the road map with u s
__label__news s support they formally accepted it but added reservations that totally eviscerated it it was done instantly it s public knowledge
__label__news knowledge i ve about it talked about it so have others but i ve never seen it mentioned in the mainstream
__label__news mainstream before and obviously they don t accept the arab league proposal or any other serious proposal in fact they ve
__label__news ve been blocking the international consensus on the two state solution for decades but hamas has to accept them it really
__label__news really makes no sense hamas is a political party and political parties don t recognize other countries and hamas itself has
__label__news has made it very clear they actually carried out a truce for a year and a half didn t respond to
__label__news to israeli attacks and have called for a long term truce during which it d be possible to negotiate a settlement
__label__news settlement along the lines of the international consensus and the arab league proposal all of this is obvious it s right
__label__news right on the surface and that s just one example of the deep hatred of democracy on the part of western
__label__news western elites it s a striking example but you can add case after case yet the president announced the freedom agenda
__label__news agenda and if the dear leader said something it s got to be true kind of north korean style therefore there
__label__news there s a freedom agenda even if there s a mountain of evidence against it the only evidence for it is
__label__news is in words even apart from the timing shank in the presidential election how will the candidates approach iran do you
__label__news you think iran will be a deciding factor in the elections chomsky what they re saying so far is not encouraging
__label__news encouraging i still think despite everything that the us is very unlikely to attack iran it could be a huge catastrophe
__label__news catastrophe nobody knows what the consequences would be i imagine that only an administration that s really desperate would resort to
__label__news to that but if the democratic candidates are on the verge of winning the election the administration is going to be
__label__news be desperate it still has the problem of iraq can t stay in and can t get out shank the senate
__label__news senate democrats can t seem to achieve consensus on this issue chomsky i think there s a reason for it the
__label__news the reason is just thinking through the consequences of allowing an independent partially democratic iraq the consequences are nontrivial we may
__label__news may decide to hide our heads in the sand and pretend we can t think it through because we cannot allow
__label__news allow the question of why the united states invaded to open but that s very self destructive shank is there any
__label__news any connection to this conversation and why we cannot find the political will and momentum to enact legislation that would reduce
__label__news reduce c emissions levels institute a cap and trade system etc chomsky it s perfectly clear why the united states didn
__label__news didn t sign the kyoto protocol again there s overwhelming popular support for signing in fact it s so strong that
__label__news that a majority of bush voters in thought that he was in favor of the kyoto protocol it s such an
__label__news an obvious thing to support popular support for alternative energy has been very high for years but it harms corporate profits
__label__news profits after all that s the administration s constituency i remember talking to years ago one of the leading people in
__label__news in the government who was involved in arms control pressing for arms control measures d eacute tente and so on he
__label__news he s very high up and we were talking about whether arms control could succeed and only partially as a joke
__label__news joke he said ldquo well it might succeed if the high tech industry makes more profit from arms control than it
__label__news it can make from weapons related research and production if we get to that tipping point maybe arms control will work
__label__news work rdquo he was partially joking but there s a truth that lies behind it shank how do we move forward
__label__news forward on climate change without beggaring the south chomsky unfortunately the poor countries the south are going to suffer the worst
__label__news worst according to most projections mdash and that being so it undermines support in the north for doing much look at
__label__news at the ozone story as long as it was the southern hemisphere that was being threatened there was very little talk
__label__news talk about it when it was discovered in the north very quickly actions were taken to do something about it right
__label__news right now there s discussion of putting serious effort into developing a malaria vaccine because global warming might extend malaria to
__label__news to the rich countries so something should be done about it same thing on health insurance here s an issue where
__label__news where for the general population it s been the leading domestic issue or close to it for years and there s
__label__news s a consensus for a national healthcare system on the model of other industrial countries maybe expanding medicare to everyone or
__label__news or something like that well that s off the agenda nobody can talk about that the insurance companies don t like
__label__news like it the financial industry doesn t like and so on now there s a change taking place what s happening
__label__news happening is that manufacturing industries are beginning to turn to support for it because they re being undermined by the hopelessly
__label__news hopelessly inefficient u s healthcare system it s the worst in the industrial world by far and they have to pay
__label__news pay for it since it s employer compensated in part their production costs are much higher than those competitors who have
__label__news have a national healthcare system take gm if it produces the same car in detroit and in windsor across the border
__label__news border in canada it saves i forget the number i think over with the windsor production because there s a national
__label__news national healthcare system it s much more efficient it s much cheaper it s much more effective so the manufacturing industry
__label__news industry is starting to press for some kind of national healthcare now it s beginning to put it on the agenda
__label__news agenda it doesn t matter if the population wants it what of the population wants would be kind of irrelevant but
__label__news but if part of the concentration of corporate capital that basically runs the country another thing we re not allowed to
__label__news to say but it s obvious if part of that sector becomes in favor then the issue moves onto the political
__label__news political agenda shank so how does the south get its voice heard on the international agenda is the world social forum
__label__news forum a place for it chomsky the world social forum is very important but of course that can t be covered
__label__news covered in the west in fact i remember reading an article i think in the financial times about the two major
__label__news major forums that were taking place one was the world economic forum in davos and a second was a forum in
__label__news in herzeliyah in israel a right wing forum in herzeliyah those were the two forums of course there was also the
__label__news the world social forum in nairobi but that s only tens of thousands of people from around the world shank with
__label__news with the trend towards vilifying the g at the un one wonders where the developing world can effectively voice their concerns
__label__news concerns chomsky the developing world voice can be amplified enormously by support from the wealthy and the privileged otherwise it s
__label__news s very likely to be marginalized as in every other issue the role of the neocons in our government since they
__label__news they invaded and occupied the white house is seldom if ever mentioned by the main stream media my information sources are
__label__news are limited and it is difficult to assess their credibility but the argument can be made that but for the neocons
__label__news neocons we would not be in danger of permanently losing our democracy with its rights and obligations duties and privileges the
__label__news the united states is in the middle of a de facto civil war the combatants are the neocons and their allies
__label__news allies the industrial military complex the main stream media and the fundamentalists on one side and those who are defending our
__label__news our constitution and the rule of law in general foreign and domestic the true patriots on the other the united states
__label__news states cannot be both a militaristic empire and a democracy such as was built on the principles set forth in our
__label__news our constitution only one side can win a uni polar world whether we talk about darfur or afganistan or iraq we
__label__news we are always honing in on a role of intervention in essentially all of these situations the context is from one
__label__news one perspective american western hegemony we rarely truly understand the complexity the history and the nuances of nations such as darfur
__label__news darfur or rwanda and most certainly iraq occasionally we see horrible conflict and want to stop it and through military intervention
__label__news intervention we exchange their horror for the one we perpetrate through our force more frequently it is pure unadulterated control of
__label__news of a region and its resources or purposes of pure arrogance the art of life and peace must supplant that of
__label__news of war as the tool for altering the course of conflict war has always begotten war regardless of intentions until we
__label__news we understand and act on it professor chomsky will always have sufficient material for his interviews and essays america s most
__label__news most senior military commanders are prepared to resign if the white house orders a military strike against iran according to highly
__label__news highly placed defense and intelligence sources tension in the gulf region has raised fears that an attack on iran is becoming
__label__news becoming increasingly likely before president george bush leaves office the sunday times has learnt that up to five generals and admirals
__label__news admirals are willing to resign rather than approve what they consider would be a reckless attack ldquo there are four or
__label__news or five generals and admirals we know of who would resign if bush ordered an attack on iran rdquo a source
__label__news source with close ties to british intelligence said ldquo there is simply no stomach for it in the pentagon and a
__label__news a lot of people question whether such an attack would be effective or even possible rdquo a british defence source confirmed
__label__news confirmed that there were deep misgivings inside the pentagon about a military strike ldquo all the generals are perfectly clear that
__label__news that they don t have the military capacity to take iran on in any meaningful fashion nobody wants to do it
__label__news it and it would be a matter of conscience for them ldquo there are enough people who feel this would be
__label__news be an error of judgment too far for there to be resignations rdquo a generals revolt on such a scale would
__label__news would be unprecedented ldquo american generals usually stay and fight until they get fired rdquo said a pentagon source robert gates
__label__news gates the defence secretary has repeatedly warned against striking iran and is believed to represent the view of his senior commanders
__label__news commanders the threat of a wave of resignations coincided with a warning by vice president dick cheney that all options including
__label__news including military action remained on the table he was responding to a comment by tony blair that it would not ldquo
__label__news ldquo be right to take military action against iran rdquo iran ignored a united nations deadline to suspend its uranium enrichment
__label__news enrichment last week president mahmoud ahmadinejad insisted that his country ldquo will not withdraw from its nuclear stances even one single
__label__news single step rdquo the international atomic energy agency reported that iran could soon produce enough enriched uranium for two nuclear bombs
__label__news bombs a year although tehran claims its is purely for civilian energy purposes nicholas burns the top us negotiator is to
__label__news to meet british french german chinese and russian officials in london tomorrow to discuss additional penalties against iran but un diplomats
__label__news diplomats cautioned that further measures would take weeks to agree and would be mild at best a second us navy aircraft

__label__news rdquo but general peter pace chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said recently there was ldquo zero chance rdquo of
__label__news of a war with iran he played down claims by us intelligence that the iranian government was responsible for supplying insurgents
__label__news insurgents in iraq forcing bush on the defensive pace s view was backed up by british intelligence officials who said the
__label__news the extent of the iranian government s involvement in activities inside iraq by a small number of revolutionary guards was ldquo
__label__news ldquo far from clear rdquo hillary mann the national security council s main iran expert until said pace s repudiation of
__label__news of the administration s claims was a sign of grave discontent at the top ldquo he is a very serious and
__label__news and a very loyal soldier rdquo she said ldquo it is extraordinary for him to have made these comments publicly and
__label__news and it suggests there are serious problems between the white house the national security council and the pentagon rdquo mann fears
__label__news fears the administration is seeking to provoke iran into a reaction that could be used as an excuse for an attack
__label__news attack a british official said the us navy was well aware of the risks of confrontation and was being ldquo seriously
__label__news seriously careful rdquo in the gulf the us air force is regarded as being more willing to attack iran general michael
__label__news michael moseley the head of the air force cited iran as the main likely target for american aircraft at a military
__label__news military conference earlier this according to a report in the new yorker magazine the pentagon has already set up a working
__label__news working group to plan airstrikes on iran the panel initially focused on destroying iran s nuclear facilities and on regime change
__label__news change but has more recently been instructed to identify targets in iran that may be involved in supplying or aiding militants
__label__news militants in iraq however army chiefs fear an attack on iran would backfire on american troops in iraq and lead to
__label__news to more terrorist attacks a rise in oil prices and the threat of a regional war britain is concerned that its
__label__news its own troops in iraq might be drawn into any american conflict with iran regardless of whether the government part in
__label__news in the attack one retired general who participated in the ldquo generals revolt rdquo against donald rumsfeld s handling of the
__label__news the iraq war said he hoped his former colleagues would resign in the event of an order to attack ldquo we
__label__news we don t want to take another initiative unless we ve really thought through the consequences of our strategy rdquo he
__label__news he warned these high ranking military officers know that iran isn t a threat to the united states just as iraq
__label__news iraq was not a threat to the united states an attack on iran would be nothing other than naked unadulterated military
__label__news military aggression and they are very courageous in contemplating resigning in the event they get quot the order quot to attack
__label__news attack iran that cheney and bush scare me is an understatement do these guys have any notion of what could possibly
__label__news possibly happen if the us attacks iran how about this iran starts sending large quantities of men and material to iraq
__label__news iraq your typical self fulfilling prophecy china and russia both of whom have huge economic s in iran respond with both
__label__news both nations providing intelligence money and arms to iran iraqi shiites further inflamed by the us attack step up insurgency activites
__label__news activites in iraq iran attempts to block oil shipments from leaving the persian gulf which results in additional us strikes against

__label__news the war on terrorism a strategic shift in the past few s as the situation in iraq has deteriorated the bush
__label__news bush administration in both its public diplomacy and its covert operations has significantly shifted its middle east strategy the ldquo redirection
__label__news redirection rdquo as some inside the white house have called the new strategy has brought the united states closer to an
__label__news an open confrontation with iran and in parts of the region propelled it into a widening sectarian conflict between shiite and
__label__news and sunni muslims to undermine iran which is predominantly shiite the bush administration has decided in effect to reconfigure its priorities
__label__news priorities in the middle east in lebanon the administration has co ouml perated with saudi arabia s government which is sunni
__label__news sunni in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken hezbollah the shiite organization that is backed by iran the u s
__label__news s has also taken part in clandestine operations aimed at iran and its ally syria a by product of these activities
__label__news activities has been the bolstering of sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of islam and are hostile to america
__label__news america and sympathetic to al qaeda one contradictory aspect of the new strategy is that in iraq most of the insurgent
__label__news insurgent violence directed at the american military has come from sunni forces and not from shiites but from the administration s
__label__news s perspective the most profound mdash and unintended mdash strategic consequence of the iraq war is the empowerment of iran its
__label__news its president mahmoud ahmadinejad has made defiant pronouncements about the destruction of israel and his country s right to pursue its
__label__news its nuclear program and last week its supreme religious leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on state television that ldquo realities in
__label__news in the region show that the arrogant front headed by the u s and its allies will be the principal loser
__label__news loser in the region rdquo after the revolution of brought a religious government to power the united states broke with iran
__label__news iran and cultivated closer relations with the leaders of sunni arab states such as jordan egypt and saudi arabia that calculation
__label__news calculation became more complex after the september th attacks especially with regard to the saudis al qaeda is sunni and many
__label__news many of its operatives came from extremist religious circles inside saudi arabia before the invasion of iraq in administration officials influenced
__label__news influenced by neoconservative ideologues assumed that a shiite government there could provide a pro american balance to sunni extremists since iraq
__label__news iraq s shiite majority had been oppressed under saddam hussein they ignored warnings from the intelligence community about the ties between
__label__news between iraqi shiite leaders and iran where some had lived in exile for years now to the distress of the white
__label__news white house iran has forged a close relationship with the shiite dominated government of prime minister nuri al maliki the new
__label__news new american policy in its broad outlines has been discussed publicly in testimony before the senate foreign relations committee in january
__label__news january secretary of state condoleezza rice said that there is ldquo a new strategic alignment in the middle east rdquo separating
__label__news separating ldquo reformers rdquo and ldquo extremists rdquo she pointed to the sunni states as centers of moderation and said that
__label__news that iran syria and hezbollah were ldquo on the other side of that divide rdquo syria s sunni majority is dominated
__label__news dominated by the alawi sect iran and syria she said ldquo have made their choice and their choice is to destabilize
__label__news destabilize rdquo some of the core tactics of the redirection are not public however the clandestine operations have been kept secret
__label__news secret in some cases by leaving the execution or the funding to the saudis or by finding other ways to work
__label__news work around the normal congressional appropriations process current and former officials close to the administration said a senior member of the
__label__news the house appropriations committee told me that he had heard about the new strategy but felt that he and his colleagues
__label__news colleagues had not been adequately briefed ldquo we haven t got any of this rdquo he said ldquo we ask for
__label__news for anything going on and they say there s nothing and when we ask specific questions they say lsquo we re
__label__news re going to get back to you it s so frustrating rdquo the key players behind the redirection are vice president
__label__news president dick cheney the deputy national security adviser elliott abrams the departing ambassador to iraq and nominee for united nations ambassador
__label__news ambassador zalmay khalilzad and prince bandar bin sultan the saudi national security adviser while rice has been deeply involved in shaping
__label__news shaping the public policy former and current officials said that the clandestine side has been guided by cheney cheney s office
__label__news office and the white house declined to comment for this story the pentagon did not respond to specific queries but said
__label__news said ldquo the united states is not planning to go to war with iran rdquo the policy shift has brought saudi
__label__news saudi arabia and israel into a new strategic embrace largely because both countries see iran as an existential threat they have
__label__news have been involved in direct talks and the saudis who believe that greater stability in israel and palestine will give iran
__label__news iran less leverage in the region have become more involved in arab israeli negotiations the new strategy ldquo is a major
__label__news major shift in american policy mdash it s a sea change rdquo a u s government consultant with close ties to
__label__news to israel said the sunni states ldquo were petrified of a shiite resurgence and there was growing resentment with our gambling
__label__news gambling on the moderate shiites in iraq rdquo he said ldquo we cannot reverse the shiite gain in iraq but we
__label__news we can contain it rdquo ldquo it seems there has been a debate inside the government over what s the biggest
__label__news biggest danger mdash iran or sunni radicals rdquo vali nasr a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations who has
__label__news has widely on shiites iran and iraq told me ldquo the saudis and some in the administration have been arguing that
__label__news that the biggest threat is iran and the sunni radicals are the lesser enemies this is a victory for the saudi
__label__news saudi line rdquo martin indyk a senior state department official in the clinton administration who also served as ambassador to israel
__label__news israel said that ldquo the middle east is heading into a serious sunni shiite cold war rdquo indyk who is the
__label__news the director of the saban center for middle east policy at the brookings institution added that in his opinion it was
__label__news was not clear whether the white house was fully aware of the strategic implications of its new policy ldquo the white
__label__news white house is not just doubling the bet in iraq rdquo he said ldquo it s doubling the bet across the
__label__news the region this could get very complicated everything is upside down rdquo the administration s new policy for containing iran seems
__label__news seems to complicate its strategy for winning the war in iraq patrick clawson an expert on iran and the deputy director
__label__news director for research at the washington institute for near east policy argued however that closer ties between the united states and
__label__news and moderate or even radical sunnis could put ldquo fear rdquo into the government of prime minister maliki and ldquo make
__label__news make him worry that the sunnis could actually win rdquo the civil war there clawson said that this might give maliki
__label__news maliki an incentive to co ouml perate with the united states in suppressing radical shiite militias such as moqtada al sadr
__label__news sadr s mahdi army even so for the moment the u s remains dependent on the co ouml peration of iraqi
__label__news iraqi shiite leaders the mahdi army may be openly hostile to american interests but other shiite militias are counted as u
__label__news u s allies both moqtada al sadr and the white house back maliki a memorandum late last year by stephen hadley
__label__news hadley the national security adviser suggested that the administration try to separate maliki from his more radical shiite allies by building
__label__news building his base among moderate sunnis and kurds but so far the trends have been in the opposite direction as the
__label__news the iraqi army continues to founder in its confrontations with insurgents the power of the shiite militias has steadily increased flynt
__label__news flynt leverett a former bush administration national security council official told me that ldquo there is nothing coincidental or ironic rdquo
__label__news rdquo about the new strategy with regard to iraq ldquo the administration is trying to make a case that iran is
__label__news is more dangerous and more provocative than the sunni insurgents to american interests in iraq when mdash if you look at
__label__news at the actual casualty numbers mdash the punishment inflicted on america by the sunnis is greater by an order of magnitude
__label__news magnitude rdquo leverett said ldquo this is all part of the campaign of provocative steps to increase the pressure on iran
__label__news iran the idea is that at some point the iranians will respond and then the administration will have an open door
__label__news door to strike at them rdquo president george w bush in a speech on january th partially spelled out this approach
__label__news approach ldquo these two regimes rdquo mdash iran and syria mdash ldquo are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their territory
__label__news territory to move in and out of iraq rdquo bush said ldquo iran is providing material support for attacks on american
__label__news american troops we will disrupt the attacks on our forces we ll interrupt the flow of support from iran and syria
__label__news syria and we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in iraq rdquo
__label__news rdquo in the ing weeks there was a wave of allegations from the administration about iranian involvement in the iraq war
__label__news war on february th reporters were shown sophisticated explosive devices captured in iraq that the administration claimed had come from iran
__label__news iran the administration s message was in essence that the bleak situation in iraq was the result not of its own
__label__news own failures of planning and execution but of iran s interference the u s military also has arrested and interrogated hundreds
__label__news hundreds of iranians in iraq ldquo the word went out last august for the military to snatch as many iranians in
__label__news in iraq as they can rdquo a former senior intelligence official said ldquo they had five hundred locked up at one
__label__news one time we re working these guys and getting information from them the white house goal is to build a case
__label__news case that the iranians have been fomenting the insurgency and they ve been doing it all along mdash that iran is
__label__news is in fact supporting the killing of americans rdquo the pentagon consultant confirmed that hundreds of iranians have been captured by
__label__news by american forces in recent s but he told me that that total includes many iranian humanitarian and aid workers who
__label__news who ldquo get scooped up and released in a short time rdquo after they have been interrogated ldquo we are not
__label__news not planning for a war with iran rdquo robert gates the new defense secretary announced on february nd and yet the
__label__news the atmosphere of confrontation has deepened according to current and former american intelligence and military officials secret operations in lebanon have
__label__news have been accompanied by clandestine operations targeting iran american military and special operations teams have escalated their activities in iran to
__label__news to gather intelligence and according to a pentagon consultant on terrorism and the former senior intelligence official have also crossed the
__label__news the border in pursuit of iranian operatives from iraq at rice s senate appearance in january democratic senator joseph biden of
__label__news of delaware pointedly asked her whether the u s planned to cross the iranian or the syrian border in the course
__label__news course of a pursuit ldquo obviously the president isn t going to rule anything out to protect our troops but the
__label__news the plan is to take down these networks in iraq rdquo rice said adding ldquo i do think that everyone will
__label__news will understand that mdash the american people and i assume the congress expect the president to do what is necessary to
__label__news to protect our forces rdquo the ambiguity of rice s reply prompted a response from nebraska senator chuck hagel a republican
__label__news republican who has been critical of the administration some of us remember madam secretary and that was cambodia and when our
__label__news our government lied to the american people and said ldquo we didn t cross the border going into cambodia rdquo in
__label__news in fact we did i happen to know something about that as do some on this committee so madam secretary when

__label__news object to the corruption and decadence among the family s myriad princes the princes are gambling that they will not be
__label__news be overthrown as long as they continue to support religious schools and charities linked to the extremists the administration s new
__label__news new strategy is heavily dependent on this bargain nasr compared the current situation to the period in which al qaeda first

__label__news i a proxy war against the soviet union in afghanistan hundreds of young saudis were sent into the border areas of

__label__news founded al qaeda in this time the u s government consultant told me bandar and other saudis have assured the white
__label__news white house that ldquo they will keep a very close eye on the religious fundamentalists their message to us was lsquo
__label__news lsquo we ve created this movement and we can control it it s not that we don t want the salafis

__label__news syrians if they continue to work with hezbollah and iran rdquo the saudi said that in his country s view it
__label__news it was taking a political risk by joining the u s in challenging iran bandar is already seen in the arab
__label__news arab world as being too close to the bush administration ldquo we have two nightmares rdquo the former diplomat told me
__label__news me ldquo for iran to acquire the bomb and for the united states to attack iran i d rather the israelis
__label__news israelis bomb the iranians so we can blame them if america does it we will be blamed rdquo in the past
__label__news past year the saudis the israelis and the bush administration have developed a series of informal understandings about their new strategic
__label__news strategic direction at least four main elements were involved the u s government consultant told me first israel would be assured
__label__news assured that its security was paramount and that washington and saudi arabia and other sunni states shared its concern about iran
__label__news iran second the saudis would urge hamas the islamist palestinian party that has received support from iran to curtail its anti
__label__news anti israeli aggression and to begin serious talks about sharing leadership with fatah the more secular palestinian group in february the
__label__news the saudis brokered a deal at mecca between the two factions however israel and the u s have expressed dissatisfaction with
__label__news with the terms the third component was that the bush administration would work directly with sunni nations to counteract shiite ascendance
__label__news ascendance in the region fourth the saudi government with washington s approval would provide funds and logistical aid to weaken the
__label__news the government of president bashir assad of syria the israelis believe that putting such pressure on the assad government will make
__label__news make it more conciliatory and open to negotiations syria is a major conduit of arms to hezbollah the saudi government is
__label__news is also at odds with the syrians over the assassination of rafik hariri the former lebanese prime minister in beirut in
__label__news in for which it believes the assad government was responsible hariri a billionaire sunni was closely associated with the saudi regime
__label__news regime and with prince bandar a u n inquiry strongly suggested that the syrians were involved but offered no direct evidence
__label__news evidence there are plans for another investigation by an international tribunal patrick clawson of the washington institute for near east policy
__label__news policy depicted the saudis co ouml peration with the white house as a significant breakthrough ldquo the saudis understand that if
__label__news if they want the administration to make a more generous political offer to the palestinians they have to persuade the arab
__label__news arab states to make a more generous offer to the israelis rdquo clawson told me the new diplomatic approach he added
__label__news added ldquo shows a real degree of effort and sophistication as well as a deftness of touch not always associated with
__label__news with this administration who s running the greater risk mdash we or the saudis at a time when america s standing
__label__news standing in the middle east is extremely low the saudis are actually embracing us we should count our blessings rdquo the
__label__news the pentagon consultant had a different view he said that the administration had turned to bandar as a ldquo fallback rdquo
__label__news rdquo because it had realized that the failing war in iraq could leave the middle east ldquo up for grabs rdquo
__label__news rdquo jihadis in lebanon the focus of the u s saudi relationship after iran is lebanon where the saudis have been
__label__news been deeply involved in efforts by the administration to support the lebanese government prime minister fouad siniora is struggling to stay

__label__news incidents nasrallah is seen by many as a staunch terrorist who has said that he regards israel as a state that
__label__news that has no right to exist many in the arab world however especially shiites view him as a resistance leader who
__label__news who withstood israel in last summer s thirty three day war and siniora as a weak politician who relies on america
__label__news america s support but was unable to persuade president bush to call for an end to the israeli bombing of lebanon
__label__news lebanon photographs of siniora kissing condoleezza rice on the cheek when she visited during the war were prominently displayed during street

__label__news to the siniora government according to the former senior intelligence official and the u s government consultant ldquo we are in
__label__news in a program to enhance the sunni capability to resist shiite influence and we re spreading the money around as much
__label__news much as we can rdquo the former senior intelligence official said the problem was that such money ldquo always gets in
__label__news in more pockets than you think it will rdquo he said ldquo in this process we re financing a lot of
__label__news of bad guys with some serious potential unintended consequences we don t have the ability to determine and get pay vouchers
__label__news vouchers signed by the people we like and avoid the people we don t like it s a very high risk
__label__news risk venture rdquo american european and arab officials i spoke to told me that the siniora government and its allies had
__label__news had allowed some aid to end up in the hands of emerging sunni radical groups in northern lebanon the bekaa valley
__label__news valley and around palestinian refugee camps in the south these groups though small are seen as a buffer to hezbollah at
__label__news at the same time their ideological ties are with al qaeda during a conversation with me the former saudi diplomat accused
__label__news accused nasrallah of attempting ldquo to hijack the state rdquo but he also objected to the lebanese and saudi sponsorship of
__label__news of sunni jihadists in lebanon ldquo salafis are sick and hateful and i m very much against the idea of flirting
__label__news flirting with them rdquo he said ldquo they hate the shiites but they hate americans more if you try to outsmart
__label__news outsmart them they will outsmart us it will be ugly rdquo alastair crooke who spent nearly thirty years in mi the

__label__news in the siniora government acknowledged that there were sunni jihadists operating inside lebanon ldquo we have a liberal attitude that allows
__label__news allows al qaeda types to have a presence here rdquo he said he related this to concerns that iran or syria
__label__news syria might decide to turn lebanon into a ldquo theatre of conflict rdquo the official said that his government was in
__label__news in a no win situation without a political settlement with hezbollah he said lebanon could ldquo slide into a conflict rdquo
__label__news rdquo in which hezbollah fought openly with sunni forces with potentially horrific consequences but if hezbollah agreed to a settlement yet
__label__news yet still maintained a separate army allied with iran and syria ldquo lebanon could become a target in both cases we
__label__news we become a target rdquo the bush administration has portrayed its support of the siniora government as an example of the
__label__news the president s belief in democracy and his desire to prevent other powers from interfering in lebanon when hezbollah led street
__label__news street demonstrations in beirut in december john bolton who was then the u s ambassador to the u n called them
__label__news them ldquo part of the iran syria inspired coup rdquo leslie h gelb a past president of the council on foreign
__label__news foreign relations said that the administration s policy was less pro democracy than ldquo pro american national security the fact is
__label__news is that it would be terribly dangerous if hezbollah ran lebanon rdquo the fall of the siniora government would be seen
__label__news seen gelb said ldquo as a signal in the middle east of the decline of the united states and the ascendancy
__label__news ascendancy of the terrorism threat and so any change in the distribution of political power in lebanon has to be opposed
__label__news opposed by the united states mdash and we re justified in helping any non shiite parties resist that change we should
__label__news should say this publicly instead of talking about democracy rdquo martin indyk of the saban center said however that the united
__label__news united states ldquo does not have enough pull to stop the moderates in lebanon from dealing with the extremists rdquo he
__label__news he added ldquo the president sees the region as divided between moderates and extremists but our regional friends see it as
__label__news as divided between sunnis and shia the sunnis that we view as extremists are regarded by our sunni allies simply as
__label__news as sunnis rdquo in january after an outburst of street violence in beirut involving supporters of both the siniora government and

__label__news had been tensions between the two countries about syrian talks with israel and the saudis goal was to encourage a breach
__label__news breach however the ambassador said ldquo it did not work syria and iran are not going to betray each other bandar
__label__news bandar s approach is very unlikely to succeed rdquo walid jumblatt who is the leader of the druze minority in lebanon
__label__news lebanon and a strong siniora supporter has attacked nasrallah as an agent of syria and has repeatedly told foreign journalists that
__label__news that hezbollah is under the direct control of the religious leadership in iran in a conversation with me last december he

__label__news rdquo of the assassination of rafik hariri and the murder last november of pierre gemayel a member of the siniora cabinet
__label__news cabinet because of his support for the syrians jumblatt then told me that he had met with vice president cheney in

__label__news that if the united states does try to move against syria members of the syrian muslim brotherhood would be ldquo the
__label__news the ones to talk to rdquo jumblatt said the syrian muslim brotherhood a branch of a radical sunni movement founded in

__label__news father in the brotherhood took control of the city of hama assad bombarded the city for a week killing between six
__label__news six thousand and twenty thousand people membership in the brotherhood is punishable by death in syria the brotherhood is also an
__label__news an avowed enemy of the u s and of israel nevertheless jumblatt said ldquo we told cheney that the basic link
__label__news link between iran and lebanon is syria mdash and to weaken iran you need to open the door to effective syrian
__label__news syrian opposition rdquo there is evidence that the administration s redirection strategy has already benefitted the brotherhood the syrian national salvation

__label__news helps the brotherhood but if you don t take on syria we will be face to face in lebanon with hezbollah
__label__news hezbollah in a long fight and one we might not win rdquo the sheikh on a warm clear night early last
__label__news last december in a bombed out suburb a few miles south of downtown beirut i got a preview of how the
__label__news the administration s new strategy might play out in lebanon sheikh hassan nasrallah the hezbollah leader who has been in hiding
__label__news hiding had agreed to an interview security arrangements for the meeting were secretive and elaborate i was driven in the back
__label__news back seat of a darkened car to a damaged underground garage somewhere in beirut searched with a handheld scanner placed in

__label__news was reported that israel was trying to kill nasrallah but the extraordinary precautions were not due only to that threat nasrallah
__label__news nasrallah s aides told me that they believe he is a prime target of fellow arabs primarily jordanian intelligence operatives as
__label__news as well as sunni jihadists who they believe are affiliated with al qaeda the government consultant and a retired four star
__label__news star general said that jordanian intelligence with support from the u s and israel had been trying to infiltrate shiite groups
__label__news groups to work against hezbollah jordan s king abdullah ii has warned that a shiite government in iraq that was close
__label__news close to iran would lead to the emergence of a shiite crescent this is something of an ironic turn nasrallah s
__label__news s battle with israel last summer turned him mdash a shiite mdash into the most popular and influential figure among sunnis
__label__news sunnis and shiites throughout the region in recent s however he has increasingly been seen by many sunnis not as a
__label__news a symbol of arab unity but as a participant in a sectarian war nasrallah dressed as usual in religious garb was
__label__news was waiting for me in an unremarkable apartment one of his advisers said that he was not likely to remain there
__label__news there overnight he has been on the move since his decision last july to order the kidnapping of two israeli soldiers
__label__news soldiers in a cross border raid set off the thirty three day war nasrallah has since said publicly mdash and repeated
__label__news repeated to me mdash that he misjudged the israeli response ldquo we just wanted to capture prisoners for exchange purposes rdquo
__label__news rdquo he told me ldquo we never wanted to drag the region into war rdquo nasrallah accused the bush administration of
__label__news of working with israel to deliberately instigate fitna an arabic word that is used to mean ldquo insurrection and fragmentation within
__label__news within islam rdquo ldquo in my opinion there is a huge campaign through the media throughout the world to put each
__label__news each side up against the other rdquo he said ldquo i believe that all this is being run by american and
__label__news and israeli intelligence rdquo he did not provide any specific evidence for this he said that the u s war in
__label__news in iraq had increased sectarian tensions but argued that hezbollah had tried to prevent them from spreading into lebanon sunni shiite
__label__news shiite confrontations increased along with violence in the weeks after we talked nasrallah said he believed that president bush s goal
__label__news goal was ldquo the drawing of a new map for the region they want the partition of iraq iraq is not
__label__news not on the edge of a civil war mdash there is a civil war there is ethnic and sectarian cleansing the
__label__news the daily killing and displacement which is taking place in iraq aims at achieving three iraqi parts which will be sectarian
__label__news sectarian and ethnically pure as a prelude to the partition of iraq within one or two years at the most there
__label__news there will be total sunni areas total shiite areas and total kurdish areas even in baghdad there is a fear that
__label__news that it might be divided into two areas one sunni and one shiite rdquo he went on ldquo i can say
__label__news say that president bush is lying when he says he does not want iraq to be partitioned all the facts occurring
__label__news occurring now on the ground make you swear he is dragging iraq to partition and a day will come when he
__label__news he will say lsquo i cannot do anything since the iraqis want the partition of their country and i honor the
__label__news the wishes of the people of iraq rdquo nasrallah said he believed that america also wanted to bring about the partition
__label__news partition of lebanon and of syria in syria he said the result would be to push the country ldquo into chaos
__label__news chaos and internal battles like in iraq rdquo in lebanon ldquo there will be a sunni state an alawi state a
__label__news a christian state and a druze state rdquo but he said ldquo i do not know if there will be a
__label__news a shiite state rdquo nasrallah told me that he suspected that one aim of the israeli bombing of lebanon last summer
__label__news summer was ldquo the destruction of shiite areas and the displacement of shiites from lebanon the idea was to have the
__label__news the shiites of lebanon and syria flee to southern iraq rdquo which is dominated by shiites ldquo i am not sure
__label__news sure but i smell this rdquo he told me partition would leave israel surrounded by ldquo small tranquil states rdquo he
__label__news he said ldquo i can assure you that the saudi kingdom will also be divided and the issue will reach to
__label__news to north african states there will be small ethnic and confessional states rdquo he said ldquo in other words israel will
__label__news will be the most important and the strongest state in a region that has been partitioned into ethnic and confessional states
__label__news states that are in agreement with each other this is the new middle east rdquo in fact the bush administration has
__label__news has adamantly resisted talk of partitioning iraq and its public stances suggest that the white house sees a future lebanon that
__label__news that is intact with a weak disarmed hezbollah playing at most a minor political role there is also no evidence to
__label__news to support nasrallah s belief that the israelis were seeking to drive the shiites into southern iraq nevertheless nasrallah s vision
__label__news vision of a larger sectarian conflict in which the united states is implicated suggests a possible consequence of the white house
__label__news house s new strategy in the interview nasrallah made mollifying gestures and promises that would likely be met with skepticism by
__label__news by his opponents ldquo if the united states says that discussions with the likes of us can be useful and influential
__label__news influential in determining american policy in the region we have no objection to talks or meetings rdquo he said ldquo but
__label__news but if their aim through this meeting is to impose their policy on us it will be a waste of time
__label__news time rdquo he said that the hezbollah militia unless attacked would operate only within the borders of lebanon and pledged to
__label__news to disarm it when the lebanese army was able to stand up nasrallah said that he had no interest in initiating
__label__news initiating another war with israel however he added that he was anticipating and preparing for another israeli attack later this year
__label__news year nasrallah further insisted that the street demonstrations in beirut would continue until the siniora government fell or met his coalition
__label__news coalition s political demands ldquo practically speaking this government cannot rule rdquo he told me ldquo it might issue orders but
__label__news but the majority of the lebanese people will not abide and will not recognize the legitimacy of this government siniora remains
__label__news remains in office because of international support but this does not mean that siniora can rule lebanon rdquo president bush s
__label__news s repeated praise of the siniora government nasrallah said ldquo is the best service to the lebanese opposition he can give
__label__news give because it weakens their position vis agrave vis the lebanese people and the arab and islamic populations they are betting
__label__news betting on us getting tired we did not get tired during the war so how could we get tired in a
__label__news a demonstration rdquo there is sharp division inside and outside the bush administration about how best to deal with nasrallah and
__label__news and whether he could in fact be a partner in a political settlement the outgoing director of national intelligence john negroponte
__label__news negroponte in a farewell briefing to the senate intelligence committee in january said that hezbollah ldquo lies at the center of

__label__news for his reports on the rise of a new mafia had been investigating allegations of tax evasion against people with links
__label__news links to the fsb the post soviet kgb nobody ever explained what shchekochikhin was allergic to and his family is convinced

__label__news have not been limited to journalists in september viktor yushchenko a candidate for president of ukraine who helped lead the orange

__label__news come to be seen by the prime minister ramzan kadyrov as a rival was gunned down on leninsky prospekt one of
__label__news of moscow s busiest thoroughfares a series of control shots were administered in front of scores of witnesses including high ranking
__label__news ranking members of the police force no arrests have been made four weeks after politkovskaya died alexander litvinenko a little known
__label__news known former kgb agent who had been imprisoned by putin and had then defected to england fell gravely ill in london
__label__news london like many others including politkovskaya litvinenko had accused the russian president of creating a pretext for the second chechen war
__label__news war in by blowing up buildings in moscow and then blaming chechen separatists for the attacks putin s decisive response to
__label__news to those acts of terrorism propelled him toward immense and lasting popularity he was outraged by litvinenko s accusation and equally
__label__news equally angered that litvinenko had fallen into the orbit of boris berezovsky one of putin s most despised enemies berezovsky a
__label__news a shady billionaire oligarch wielded huge power in the yeltsin years helped bring putin to yeltsin s attention and even played
__label__news played a major role in persuading him to assume the presidency once putin took power though berezovsky found himself shut off
__label__news off from the kremlin he accused putin of turning his back on yeltsin s reforms and was driven from the country
__label__news country litvinenko subsequently charged that his fsb superiors had ordered him to kill berezovsky on his deathbed he accused putin of
__label__news of killing him he also blamed putin for politkovskaya s death the manner of litvinenko s poisoning was obscure almost until
__label__news until the moment he died at first doctors thought he had an unusual bacterial infection then they said that his symptoms
__label__news symptoms pointed toward rat poison when his immune system started to fail they thought it more likely the poison was a
__label__news a radioactive form of thallium which had been used by the kgb nearly years earlier in a failed attempt to assassinate
__label__news assassinate nikolai khokhlov an agent who had refused to comply with an order to kill a prominent russian dissident finally just
__label__news just hours before litvinenko died the doctors provided a definitive and even more improbable diagnosis he had been poisoned with polonium
__label__news polonium a rare radioactive isotope a millionth of a gram is enough to destroy a person s bodily organs litvinenko s
__label__news s murder was the first known case of nuclear terrorism perpetrated against an individual in moscow a city given to conspiracy
__label__news conspiracy theories people could speak of little else putin had acted to silence a vocal traitor no putin s enemies did
__label__news did it to destroy the image of the kremlin and gain leverage in the presidential campaign putin s allies did it
__label__news it so that they could use the affair as a convenient excuse to ignore the constitution and secure him a third
__label__news third term the jews did it because litvinenko had converted to islam muslim extremists did it because litvinenko had reneged on
__label__news on a promise to supply parts for a dirty bomb berezovsky did it to embarrass putin the kremlin even suggested that
__label__news that leonid nevzlin a wealthy oil executive who had fled russia and lives in israel might have been involved there was
__label__news was no proof for any of these assertions last july however the duma passed a law introduced by the kremlin to
__label__news to permit the assassination of enemies of the russian regime abroad for people like boris berezovsky whose hatred for putin has
__label__news has become an obsession the new law explained everything this guy is a kgb guy berezovsky told me one afternoon over
__label__news over tea at a london hotel this guy issues a law allowing the russians to kill opponents abroad so they kill
__label__news kill opponents abroad his voice rose and he shrugged and then he glanced at me as if to say how could
__label__news could one draw any other conclusion this is absolutely logical why did they issue this law for what because this is
__label__news is russia and nobody agrees to kill without the signature of somebody more important who gave the order the kremlin has
__label__news has denied any involvement in litvinenko s death whatever the truth the manner in which he died has tarnished putin s
__label__news s reputation in the west and so has the execution of a journalist who had been accused of nothing more than
__label__news than doing her job at first putin like most other russians tried to ignore the politkovskaya murder he refused even to
__label__news to make a gesture of sympathy as mourners gathered at services in helsinki paris and new york and as many others
__label__news others most of them members of moscow s dwindling liberal establishment laid flowers on the doorstep of politkovskaya s apartment building
__label__news building and attended her funeral at the troyekurovskoye cemetery on the outskirts of moscow the president said nothing on october he
__label__news he travelled to dresden where he had been stationed as a kgb operative in the eighties for a meeting with the
__label__news the german chancellor angela merkel afterwards they appeared at a press conference and putin was no longer able to avoid questions
__label__news questions about the killing he responded curtly she was well known in the media community in human rights circles and in
__label__news in the west but her influence on political life within russia was very minimal in my opinion she was too radical
__label__news radical and by virtue of this radicalism she did not have a very strong influence on political life within the country
__label__news country and especially in chechnya the president s detached and clinical approach to the murder infuriated politkovskaya s colleagues and shocked
__label__news shocked her family it was like he was saying she was of no value to the kremlin so she didn t
__label__news t deserve to live elena kudimova told me i don t care what he thought of her work but what kind
__label__news kind of man speaks that way about the dead euphoria cannot sustain a business however when yeltsin instituted the economic reforms
__label__news reforms known as shock therapy in prices soared and the cost of publishing a newspaper became prohibitive there were no advertisements
__label__news advertisements and subscriptions all but evaporated along with whatever innocence remained the moral tone of the journalistic world began to shift
__label__news shift from idealistic to mercenary the practice of writing biased news articles for money became routine even at the best papers
__label__news papers restaurant owners businessmen and public officials knew that the right price would bring them favourable coverage almost anywhere it would
__label__news would be good to say we had our hands clean at all times raf shakirov who later became the editor of
__label__news of izvestia told me we tried but it was done by everyone absolutely everyone as the process of soviet disintegration accelerated
__label__news accelerated the yeltsin government was consumed by economic and social chaos leaders of several russian regions including siberia and yakutia both
__label__news both with vast reserves of diamonds oil and gold beneath their frozen ground began to speak openly of seceding one soviet
__label__news soviet general dzhokhar dudayev watched from his post in estonia as the baltic republics demanded independence he resigned his commission as
__label__news as commander of a strategic wing of nuclear bombers went home to grozny and after a dubious election proclaimed himself the
__label__news the leader of an independent chechnya boris yeltsin did not take the chechen threat seriously but he began to worry that
__label__news that this rebellion in a part of the country that had been hostile to moscow for centuries might set off similar
__label__news similar demands in other republics yeltsin was struggling to keep the country together and in he was even forced to turn
__label__news turn his tanks against his own mutinous parliament by the end of the ing year yeltsin had heard enough talk of
__label__news of chechen independence to those who encouraged the president to negotiate as he had with tatarstan and other regions seeking greater
__label__news greater autonomy yeltsin replied by asking if the president of russia should really be bargaining with a bunch of shepherds pavel
__label__news pavel grachev the defence minister promised that he could win a war against dudayev s forces with one paratroop regiment in
__label__news in two hours and yeltsin told him to go ahead instead what became known as the first chechen war dragged on
__label__news on for nearly two years by the time it ended in the summer of grozny had been levelled tens of thousands
__label__news thousands of russians and chechens had died and europe s largest army had been forced into a historic retreat most russians
__label__news russians had quickly come to oppose the war in chechnya largely because of reports they saw on tv particularly on the
__label__news the ntv network ntv was owned by vladimir gusinsky one of the earliest moscow oligarchs its correspondents were fearless those pictures
__label__news pictures created an overwhelming sense that the war was unjust and that yeltsin had to end it masha lipman who was
__label__news was the deputy editor of gusinsky s magazine itogi said it hurt him very badly his popularity plummeted the war was
__label__news was seen as cruel for the first time the russian press had played a central role in altering the nation s
__label__news s political direction indeed with the single exception of the economic windfall granted to a few well placed men oligarchs who
__label__news who were permitted to buy state property at ludicrously low prices the war in chechnya did more to unravel the promise
__label__news promise of yeltsin s presidency than any other event the young liberals who worked at moscow s newspapers and television stations
__label__news stations and had championed yeltsin s rise during the gorbachev years were terrified their liberties would vanish under a neo communist
__label__news communist government for all his faults and his increasing malevolence yeltsin rarely challenged the right of the press to do its
__label__news its job in chechnya or anywhere else yeltsin was an opportunist as every politician is igor malashenko the founding president of
__label__news of ntv told me recently he had personal flaws and made mis but he did not need to control everything he
__label__news he had a visceral taste for democracy and freedom and he loved the mess so despite yeltsin s precarious health his
__label__news his loss of public support and an inner circle riven by factional disputes and corruption the most influential journalists in russia
__label__news russia led by malashenko and ntv decided nothing was more important than protecting yeltsin they wanted to drive communism from russia
__label__news russia forever impartiality they felt was too decorous a response to what they saw as a national emergency as a moscow
__label__news moscow correspondent for the new york times i saw many of my friends were certain that a yeltsin loss would be
__label__news be a disaster for the country one day i travelled with the press corps to novosibirsk a centre of soviet era

__label__news russian press however were disgusted we got rid of this shit one of them told me that night and we are
__label__news are never going to let it back never they wrote accordingly any suggestion that journalism shouldn t work that way was
__label__news was rebuffed with assertions that people in america and europe had less at stake when ntv was busy reflecting yeltsin when
__label__news when he had two per cent and it magically went to per cent why didn t you in the west say
__label__news say careful russia this will lead to a system you will regret leonid parfyonov asked me recently until two years ago
__label__news ago parfyonov was the nation s most influential television host but he was abruptly fired after a dispute with the kremlin
__label__news kremlin over the censoring of his sunday night political news programme he is now the editor of the russian edition of
__label__news of newsweek no we never got that from the west you all said good job yeltsin good zyuganov bad you prevented
__label__news prevented the return of communism as much as we did that is true no doubt but when russia s young democrats
__label__news democrats jettisoned the rules of democracy they also forfeited their independence that made what came next for the media and for
__label__news for russia possible perhaps even inevitable the election put a poison seed into the soil andrei norkin a former anchor for
__label__news for ntv told me norkin now works for the satellite network rtv which is owned by vladimir gusinsky and even if
__label__news if we did not see why the authorities understood at once mass media could very easily be manipulated to achieve any
__label__news any goal whether the kremlin needed to raise the rating of a president or bring down an opponent or conduct an
__label__news an operation to destroy a business or a man the media could do the job once the kremlin understood that it
__label__news it could use journalists as instruments of its will and saw that journalists would go along everything that happened in the
__label__news the putin era was sadly quite logical a few s before putin became president in there was a battle for control
__label__news control of parliament and by implication the government as russia prepared for the end of yeltsin s administration one group was
__label__news was backed by the kremlin and the other by former prime minister yevgeny primakov and the extraordinarily powerful mayor of moscow
__label__news moscow yuri luzhkov the outcome was determined wholly by television coverage most newspapers had lost what influence they had had channel

__label__news as alexander rodnyansky who is the head of ctc one of russia s major television networks put it television is the

__label__news venezuela along the way chomsky also commented on climate change the world social forum and why international relations are run like
__label__news like the mafia shank with similar nuclear developments in north korea and why has the united states pursued direct diplomacy with
__label__news with north korea but refuses to do so with chomsky to say that the united states has pursued diplomacy with north
__label__news north korea is a little bit misleading it did under the clinton administration though neither side completely lived up to their
__label__news their obligations clinton didn rsquo t do what was promised nor did north korea but they were making progress so when
__label__news when bush came into the presidency north korea had enough uranium or plutonium for maybe one or two bombs but then
__label__news then very limited missile capacity during the bush years it rsquo s exploded the reason is he immediately canceled the diplomacy
__label__news diplomacy and he rsquo s pretty much blocked it ever since they made a very substantial agreement in september in which
__label__news which north korea agreed to eliminate its enrichment programs and nuclear development completely in return the united states agreed to terminate
__label__news terminate the threats of attack and to begin moving towards the planning for the provision of a light water reactor which
__label__news which had been promised under the framework agreement but the bush administration instantly undermined it right away they canceled the international
__label__news international consortium that was planning for the light water reactor which was a way of saying we rsquo re not going
__label__news going to agree to this agreement a couple of days later they started attacking the financial transactions of various banks it
__label__news it was timed in such a way to make it clear that the united states was not going to move towards
__label__news towards its commitment to improve relations and of course it never withdrew the threats so that was the end of the
__label__news the september agreement that one is now coming back just in the last few days the way it rsquo s portrayed
__label__news portrayed in the u s media is as usual with the government rsquo s party line that north korea is now
__label__news now perhaps a little more amenable to accept the september proposal so there rsquo s some optimism if you go across
__label__news across the atlantic to the financial times to review the same events they point out that an embattled bush administration it
__label__news it rsquo s their phrase needs some kind of victory so maybe it rsquo ll be willing to move towards diplomacy
__label__news diplomacy it rsquo s a little more accurate i think if you look at the background but there is some minimal
__label__news minimal sense of optimism about it if you look back over the record mdash and north korea is a horrible place
__label__news place nobody is arguing about that mdash on this issue they rsquo ve been pretty rational it rsquo s been a
__label__news a kind of tit for tat history if the united states is accommodating the north koreans become accommodating if the united
__label__news united states is hostile they become hostile that rsquo s reviewed pretty well by leon sigal who rsquo s one of
__label__news of the leading specialists on this in a recent issue of current history but that rsquo s been the general picture
__label__news picture and we rsquo re now at a place where there could be a settlement on north korea that rsquo s
__label__news s much less significant for the united states than the iranian issue i don rsquo t think has much to do
__label__news do with nuclear weapons frankly nobody is saying iran should have nuclear weapons ndash nor should anybody else but the point
__label__news point in the middle east as distinct from north korea is that this is center of the world rsquo s energy
__label__news energy resources originally the british and secondarily the french had dominated it but after the second world war it rsquo s
__label__news s been a u s preserve that rsquo s been an axiom of u s foreign policy that it must control
__label__news control middle east energy resources it is not a matter of access as people often say once the oil is on
__label__news on the seas it goes anywhere in fact if the united states used no middle east oil it rsquo d have
__label__news have the same policies if we went on solar energy tomorrow it rsquo d keep the same policies just look at
__label__news at the internal record or the logic of it the issue has always been control control is the source of strategic
__label__news strategic power dick cheney declared in kazakhstan or somewhere that control over pipeline is a ldquo tool of intimidation and blackmail
__label__news blackmail rdquo when we have control over the pipelines it rsquo s a tool of benevolence if other countries have control
__label__news control over the sources of energy and the distribution of energy then it is a tool of intimidation and blackmail exactly
__label__news exactly as cheney said and that rsquo s been understood as far back as george kennan and the early post war
__label__news war days when he pointed out that if the united states controls middle east resources it rsquo ll have veto power
__label__news power over its industrial rivals he was speaking particularly of japan but the point generalizes so is a different situation it
__label__news it rsquo s part of the major energy system of the world shank so when the united states considers a potential
__label__news potential invasion you think it rsquo s under the premise of gaining control that is what the united states will gain
__label__news gain from attacking chomsky there are several issues in the case of iran one is simply that it is independent and
__label__news and independence is not tolerated sometimes it rsquo s called successful defiance in the internal record take cuba a very large
__label__news large majority of the u s population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with cuba and has been for a
__label__news a long time with some fluctuations and even part of the business world is in favor of it too but the
__label__news the government won rsquo t allow it it rsquo s attributed to the florida vote but i don rsquo t think
__label__news think that rsquo s much of an explanation i think it has to do with a feature of world affairs that
__label__news that is insufficiently appreciated international affairs is very much run like the mafia the godfather does not accept disobedience even from
__label__news from a small storekeeper who doesn rsquo t pay his protection money you have to have obedience otherwise the idea can
__label__news can spread that you don rsquo t have to listen to the orders and it can spread to important places if
__label__news if you look back at the record what was the main reason for the u s attack on vietnam independent development
__label__news development can be a virus that can infect others that rsquo s the way it rsquo s been put kissinger in
__label__news in this case referring to allende in chile and with cuba it rsquo s explicit in the internal record arthur schlesinger
__label__news schlesinger presenting the report of the latin american study group to incoming president kennedy wrote that the danger is the spread
__label__news spread of the castro idea of taking matters into your own hands which has a lot of appeal to others in
__label__news in the same region that suffer from the same problems later internal documents charged cuba with successful defiance of u s
__label__news s policies going back years ndash to the monroe doctrine and that can rsquo t be tolerated so there rsquo s
__label__news s kind of a state commitment to ensuring obedience going back to iran it rsquo s not only that it has
__label__news has substantial resources and that it rsquo s part of the world rsquo s major energy system but it also defied
__label__news defied the united states the united states as we know overthrew the parliamentary government installed a brutal tyrant was helping him
__label__news him develop nuclear power in fact the very same programs that are now considered a threat were being sponsored by the
__label__news the u s government by cheney wolfowitz kissinger and others in the s as long as the shah was in power
__label__news power but then the iranians overthrew him and they kept u s hostages for several hundred days and the united states
__label__news states immediately turned to supporting saddam hussein and his war against as a way of punishing iran the united states is
__label__news is going to continue to punish iran because of its defiance so that rsquo s a separate factor and again the
__label__news the will of the u s population and even us business is considered mostly irrelevant seventy five percent of the population
__label__news population here favors improving relations with iran instead of threats but this is disregarded we don rsquo t have polls from
__label__news from the business world but it rsquo s pretty clear that the energy corporations would be quite happy to be given
__label__news given authorization to go back into iran instead of leaving all that to their rivals but the state won rsquo t
__label__news t allow it and it is setting up confrontations right now very explicitly part of the reason is strategic geo political
__label__news political economic but part of the reason is the mafia complex they have to be punished for disobeying us shank venezuela
__label__news venezuela has been successfully defiant with chavez making a swing towards socialism where are they on our list chomsky they rsquo
__label__news rsquo re very high the united states sponsored and supported a military coup to overthrow the government in fact that rsquo
__label__news rsquo s its last most recent effort in what used to be a conventional resort to such measures shank but why
__label__news why haven rsquo t we turned our sights more toward venezuela chomsky oh they rsquo re there there rsquo s a
__label__news a constant stream of abuse and attack by the government and therefore the media who are almost reflexively against venezuela for
__label__news for several reasons venezuela is independent it rsquo s diversifying its exports to a limited extent instead of just being dependent
__label__news dependent on exports to the united states and it rsquo s initiating moves toward latin american integration and independence it rsquo
__label__news rsquo s what they call a bolivarian alternative and the united states doesn rsquo t like any of that this again
__label__news again is defiance of u s policies going back to the monroe doctrine there rsquo s now a standard interpretation of
__label__news of this trend in latin america another kind of party line latin america is all moving to the left from venezuela
__label__news venezuela to argentina with rare exceptions but there rsquo s a good left and a bad left the good left is
__label__news is garcia and lula and then there rsquo s the bad left which is chavez morales maybe correa and that rsquo
__label__news rsquo s the split in order to maintain that position it rsquo s necessary to resort to some fancy footwork for
__label__news for example it rsquo s necessary not to report the fact that when lula was re elected in october his foreign
__label__news foreign trip and one of his first acts was to visit caracas to support chavez and his electoral campaign and to
__label__news to dedicate a joint venezuelan brazilian project on the orinoco river to talk about new projects and so on it rsquo
__label__news rsquo s necessary not to report the fact that a couple of weeks later in cochabamba bolivia which is the heart
__label__news heart of the bad guys there was a meeting of all south american leaders there had been bad blood between chavez
__label__news chavez and garcia but it was apparently patched up they laid plans for pretty constructive south american integration but that just
__label__news just doesn rsquo t fit the u s agenda so it wasn rsquo t reported shank how is the political deadlock
__label__news deadlock in lebanon impacting the u s government rsquo s decision to potentially go to war with iran is there a
__label__news a relationship at all chomsky there rsquo s a relationship i presume part of the reason for the u s israel
__label__news israel invasion of lebanon in july mdash and it is us israeli the lebanese are correct in calling it that mdash
__label__news mdash part of the reason i suppose was that hezbollah is considered a deterrent to a potential u s israeli attack
__label__news attack on iran it had a deterrent capacity i e rockets and the goal i presume was to wipe out the
__label__news the deterrent so as to free up the united states and israel for an eventual attack on iran that rsquo s
__label__news s at least part of the reason the official reason given for the invasion can rsquo t be taken seriously for
__label__news for a moment that rsquo s the capture of two israeli soldiers and the killing of a couple others for decades
__label__news decades israel has been capturing and kidnapping lebanese and palestinian refugees on the high seas from cyprus to lebanon killing them
__label__news them in lebanon bringing them to israel holding them as hostages it rsquo s been going on for decades has anybody
__label__news anybody called for an invasion of israel of course israel doesn rsquo t want any competition in the region but there
__label__news there rsquo s no principled basis for the massive attack on lebanon which was horrendous in fact one of the last
__label__news last acts of the u s israeli invasion right after the ceasefire was announced before it was implemented was to saturate
__label__news saturate much of the south with cluster bombs there rsquo s no military purpose for that the war was over the
__label__news the ceasefire was coming un de mining groups that are working there say that the scale is unprecedented it rsquo s
__label__news s much worse than any other place they rsquo ve worked kosovo afghanistan iraq anywhere there are supposed to be about
__label__news about one million bomblets left there a large percentage of them don rsquo t explode until you pick them up a
__label__news a child picks them up or a farmer hits it with a hoe or something so what it does basically is
__label__news is make the south uninhabitable until the mining teams for which the united states and israel don rsquo t contribute clean
__label__news clean it up this is arable land it means that farmers can rsquo t go back it means that it may
__label__news may undermine a potential hezbollah deterrent they apparently have pretty much withdrawn from the south according to the un you can
__label__news can rsquo t mention hezbollah in the u s media without putting in the context of ldquo iranian supported hezbollah rdquo
__label__news rdquo that rsquo s its name its name is iranian supported hezbollah it gets iranian support but you can mention israel
__label__news israel without saying us supported israel so this is more tacit propaganda the idea that hezbollah is acting as an agent
__label__news agent of iran is very dubious it rsquo s not accepted by specialists on iran or specialists on hezbollah but it
__label__news it rsquo s the party line or sometimes you can put in syria i e ldquo syrian supported hezbollah rdquo but
__label__news but since syria is of less interest now you have to emphasize iranian support shank how can the u s government
__label__news government think an attack on iran is feasible given troop availability troop capacity and public sentiment chomsky as far as i
__label__news i rsquo m aware the military in the united states thinks it rsquo s crazy and from whatever leaks we have
__label__news have from intelligence the intelligence community thinks it rsquo s outlandish but not impossible if you look at people who have
__label__news have really been involved in the pentagon rsquo s strategic planning for years people like sam gardiner they point out that
__label__news that there are things that possibly could be done i don rsquo t think any of the outside commentators at least
__label__news least as far as i rsquo m aware have taken very seriously the idea of bombing nuclear facilities they say if
__label__news if there will be bombing it rsquo ll be carpet bombing so get the nuclear facilities but get the rest of
__label__news of the country too with an exception by accident of geography the world rsquo s major oil resources are in shi
__label__news shi rsquo ite dominated areas iran rsquo s oil is concentrated right near the gulf which happens to be an arab
__label__news arab area not persian khuzestan is arab has been loyal to iran fought with iran not iraq during the iran iraq
__label__news iraq war this is a potential source of dissension i would be amazed if there isn rsquo t an attempt going
__label__news going on to stir up secessionist elements in khuzestan u s forces right across the border in iraq including the surge
__label__news surge are available potentially to ldquo defend rdquo an independent khuzestan against iran which is the way it would be put
__label__news put if they can carry it off shank do you think that rsquo s what the surge was for chomsky that
__label__news that rsquo s one possibility there was a release of a pentagon war gaming report in december with gardiner leading it
__label__news it it was released and published in the atlantic ly they couldn rsquo t come up with a proposal that didn
__label__news didn rsquo t lead to disaster but one of the things they considered was maintaining troop presence in iraq beyond what
__label__news what rsquo s to be used in iraq for troop replacement and so on and use them for a potential land
__label__news land move in iran presumably khuzestan where the oil is if you could carry that off you could just bomb the
__label__news the rest of the country to dust again i would be amazed if there aren rsquo t efforts to sponsor secessionist
__label__news secessionist movements elsewhere among the azeri population for example it rsquo s a very complex ethnic mix in iran much of
__label__news of the population isn rsquo t persian there are secessionist tendencies anyway and almost certainly without knowing any of the facts
__label__news facts the united states is trying to stir them up to break the country internally if possible the strategy appears to
__label__news to be try to break the country up internally try to impel the leadership to be as harsh and brutal as
__label__news as possible that rsquo s the immediate consequence of constant threats everyone knows that that rsquo s one of the reasons
__label__news reasons the reformists shirin ebadi and akbar ganji and others are bitterly complaining about the u s threats that it rsquo
__label__news rsquo s undermining their efforts to reform and democratize iran but that rsquo s presumably its purpose since it rsquo s
__label__news s an obvious consequence you have to assume it rsquo s the purpose just like in law anticipated consequences are taken
__label__news taken as the evidence for intention and here rsquo s it so obvious you can rsquo t seriously doubt it so
__label__news so it could be that one strain of the policy is to stir up secessionist movements particularly in the oil rich
__label__news rich regions the arab regions near the gulf also the azeri regions and others second is to try to get the
__label__news the leadership to be as brutal and harsh and repressive as possible to stir up internal disorder and maybe resistance and
__label__news and a third is to try to pressure other countries and europe is the most amenable to join efforts to strangle
__label__news strangle iran economically europe is kind of dragging its feet but they usually go along with the united states the efforts
__label__news efforts to intensify the harshness of the regime show up in many ways for example the west absolutely adores ahmadinejad any
__label__news any wild statement that he comes out with immediately gets circulated in headlines and mistranslated they love him but anybody who
__label__news who knows anything about iran presumably the editorial offices knows that he doesn rsquo t have anything to do with foreign
__label__news foreign policy foreign policy is in the hands of his superior the supreme leader khamenei but they don rsquo t report
__label__news report his statements particularly when his statements are pretty conciliatory for example they love when ahmadinejad says that israel shouldn rsquo
__label__news rsquo t exist but they don rsquo t like it when khamenei right afterwards says that iran supports the arab league
__label__news league position on israel palestine as far as i rsquo m aware it never got reported actually you could find khamenei
__label__news khamenei rsquo s more conciliatory positions in the financial times but not here and it rsquo s repeated by iranian diplomats
__label__news diplomats but that rsquo s no good the arab league proposal calls for normalization of relations with israel if it accepts
__label__news accepts the international consensus of the two state settlement which has been blocked by the united states and israel for thirty
__label__news thirty years and that rsquo s not a good story so it rsquo s either not mentioned or it rsquo s
__label__news s hidden somewhere it rsquo s very hard to predict the bush administration today because they rsquo re deeply irrational they
__label__news they were irrational to start with but now they rsquo re desperate they have created an unimaginable catastrophe in iraq this
__label__news this should rsquo ve been one of the easiest military occupations in history and they succeeded in turning it into one
__label__news one of the worst military disasters in history they can rsquo t control it and it rsquo s almost impossible for
__label__news for them to get out for reasons you can rsquo t discuss in the united states because to discuss the reasons
__label__news reasons why they can rsquo t get out would be to concede the reasons why they invaded we rsquo re supposed
__label__news supposed to believe that oil had nothing to do with it that if iraq were exporting pickles or jelly and the
__label__news the center of world oil production were in the south pacific that the united states would rsquo ve liberated them anyway
__label__news anyway it has nothing to do with the oil what a crass idea anyone with their head screwed on knows that
__label__news that that can rsquo t be true allowing an independent and sovereign iraq could be a nightmare for the united states
__label__news states it would mean that it would be shi rsquo ite dominated at least if it rsquo s minimally democratic it
__label__news it would continue to improve relations with iran just what the united states doesn rsquo t want to see and beyond
__label__news beyond that right across the border in saudi arabia where most of saudi oil is there happens to be a large
__label__news large shi rsquo ite population probably a majority moves toward sovereignty in iraq stimulate pressures first for human rights among the
__label__news the bitterly repressed shi rsquo ite population but also toward some degree of autonomy you can imagine a kind of a
__label__news a loose shi rsquo ite alliance in iraq saudi arabia and iran controlling most of the world rsquo s oil and
__label__news and independent of the united states and much worse although europe can be intimidated by the united states china can rsquo
__label__news rsquo t it rsquo s one of the reasons the main reasons why china is considered a threat we rsquo re
__label__news re back to the mafia principle china has been there for years has contempt for the barbarians is overcoming a century
__label__news century of domination and simply moves on its own it does not get intimidated when uncle sam shakes his fist that
__label__news that rsquo s scary in particular it rsquo s dangerous in the case of the middle east china is the center
__label__news center of the asian energy security grid which includes the central asian states and russia india is also hovering around the
__label__news the edge south korea is involved and iran is an associate member of some kind if the middle east oil resources
__label__news resources around the gulf which are the main ones in the world if they link up to the asian grid the
__label__news the united states is really a second rate power a lot is at stake in not withdrawing from iraq i rsquo
__label__news rsquo m sure that these issues are discussed in internal planning it rsquo s inconceivable that they can rsquo t think
__label__news think of this but it rsquo s out of public discussion it rsquo s not in the media it rsquo s
__label__news s not in the journals it rsquo s not in the baker hamilton report and i think you can understand the
__label__news the reason to bring up these issues would open the question why the united states and britain invaded and that question
__label__news question is taboo it rsquo s a principle that anything our leaders do is for noble reasons it may be mistaken
__label__news mistaken it may be ugly but basically noble and if you bring in normal moderate conservative strategic economic objectives you threatening
__label__news threatening that principle it rsquo s remarkable the extent to which it rsquo s held so the original pretexts for the
__label__news the invasion were weapons of mass destruction and ties to al qaida that nobody but maybe wolfowitz or cheney took seriously
__label__news seriously the single question as they kept reiterating in the leadership was will saddam give up his programs of weapons of
__label__news of mass destruction the single question was answered a couple of s later the wrong way and quickly the party line
__label__news line shifted in november bush announced his freedom agenda our real goal is to bring democracy to iraq to transform the
__label__news the middle east that became the party line instantly but it rsquo s a mistake to pick out individuals because it
__label__news it rsquo s close to universal even in scholarship in fact you can even find scholarly articles that begin by giving
__label__news giving the evidence that it rsquo s complete farce but nevertheless accept it there was a pretty good study of the
__label__news the freedom agenda in current history by two scholars and they give the facts they point out that the freedom agenda
__label__news agenda was announced on november after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction but the freedom agenda is real even
__label__news even if there rsquo s no evidence for it in fact if you look at our policies they rsquo re the
__label__news the opposite take palestine there was a free election in palestine but it came out the wrong way so instantly the
__label__news the united states and israel with europe tagging along moved to punish the palestinian people and punish them harshly because they
__label__news they voted the wrong way in a free election that rsquo s accepted here in the west as perfectly normal that
__label__news that illustrates the deep hatred and contempt for democracy among western elites so deep seated they can rsquo t even perceive
__label__news perceive it when it rsquo s in front of their eyes you punish people severely if they vote the wrong way
__label__news way in a free election there rsquo s a pretext for that too repeated every day hamas must agree to first
__label__news first recognize israel second to end all violence third to accept past agreements try to find a mention of the fact
__label__news fact that the united states and israel reject all three of those they obviously don rsquo t recognize palestine they certainly
__label__news certainly don rsquo t withdraw the use of violence or the threat of it in fact they insist on it and
__label__news and they don rsquo t accept past agreements including the road map i suspect one of the reasons why jimmy carter
__label__news carter rsquo s book has come under such fierce attack is because it rsquo s the first time i think in
__label__news in the mainstream that one can find the truth about the road map i have never seen anything in the mainstream
__label__news mainstream that discusses the fact that israel instantly rejected the road map with u s support they formally accepted it but
__label__news but added reservations that totally eviscerated it it was done instantly it rsquo s public knowledge i rsquo ve about it
__label__news it talked about it so have others but i rsquo ve never seen it mentioned in the mainstream before and obviously
__label__news obviously they don rsquo t accept the arab league proposal or any other serious proposal in fact they rsquo ve been
__label__news been blocking the international consensus on the two state solution for decades but hamas has to accept them it really makes
__label__news makes no sense hamas is a political party and political parties don rsquo t recognize other countries and hamas itself has
__label__news has made it very clear they actually carried out a truce for a year and a half didn rsquo t respond
__label__news respond to israeli attacks and have called for a long term truce during which it rsquo d be possible to negotiate
__label__news negotiate a settlement along the lines of the international consensus and the arab league proposal all of this is obvious it
__label__news it rsquo s right on the surface and that rsquo s just one example of the deep hatred of democracy on
__label__news on the part of western elites it rsquo s a striking example but you can add case after case yet the
__label__news the president announced the freedom agenda and if the dear leader said something it rsquo s got to be true kind
__label__news kind of north korean style therefore there rsquo s a freedom agenda even if there rsquo s a mountain of evidence
__label__news evidence against it the only evidence for it is in words even apart from the timing shank in the presidential election
__label__news election how will the candidates approach iran do you think iran will be a deciding factor in the elections chomsky what
__label__news what they rsquo re saying so far is not encouraging i still think despite everything that the us is very unlikely
__label__news unlikely to attack iran it could be a huge catastrophe nobody knows what the consequences would be i imagine that only
__label__news only an administration that rsquo s really desperate would resort to that but if the democratic candidates are on the verge
__label__news verge of winning the election the administration is going to be desperate it still has the problem of iraq can rsquo
__label__news rsquo t stay in and can rsquo t get out shank the senate democrats can rsquo t seem to achieve consensus
__label__news consensus on this issue chomsky i think there rsquo s a reason for it the reason is just thinking through the
__label__news the consequences of allowing an independent partially democratic iraq the consequences are nontrivial we may decide to hide our heads in
__label__news in the sand and pretend we can rsquo t think it through because we cannot allow the question of why the
__label__news the united states invaded to open but that rsquo s very self destructive shank is there any connection to this conversation
__label__news conversation and why we cannot find the political will and momentum to enact legislation that would reduce c emissions levels institute
__label__news institute a cap and trade system etc chomsky it rsquo s perfectly clear why the united states didn rsquo t sign
__label__news sign the kyoto protocol again there rsquo s overwhelming popular support for signing in fact it rsquo s so strong that
__label__news that a majority of bush voters in thought that he was in favor of the kyoto protocol it rsquo s such
__label__news such an obvious thing to support popular support for alternative energy has been very high for years but it harms corporate
__label__news corporate profits after all that rsquo s the administration rsquo s constituency i remember talking to years ago one of the
__label__news the leading people in the government who was involved in arms control pressing for arms control measures d eacute tente and
__label__news and so on he rsquo s very high up and we were talking about whether arms control could succeed and only
__label__news only partially as a joke he said ldquo well it might succeed if the high tech industry makes more profit from
__label__news from arms control than it can make from weapons related research and production if we get to that tipping point maybe
__label__news maybe arms control will work rdquo he was partially joking but there rsquo s a truth that lies behind it shank
__label__news shank how do we move forward on climate change without beggaring the south chomsky unfortunately the poor countries the south are
__label__news are going to suffer the worst according to most projections mdash and that being so it undermines support in the north
__label__news north for doing much look at the ozone story as long as it was the southern hemisphere that was being threatened
__label__news threatened there was very little talk about it when it was discovered in the north very quickly actions were taken to
__label__news to do something about it right now there rsquo s discussion of putting serious effort into developing a malaria vaccine because
__label__news because global warming might extend malaria to the rich countries so something should be done about it same thing on health
__label__news health insurance here rsquo s an issue where for the general population it rsquo s been the leading domestic issue or
__label__news or close to it for years and there rsquo s a consensus for a national healthcare system on the model of
__label__news of other industrial countries maybe expanding medicare to everyone or something like that well that rsquo s off the agenda nobody
__label__news nobody can talk about that the insurance companies don rsquo t like it the financial industry doesn rsquo t like and
__label__news and so on now there rsquo s a change taking place what rsquo s happening is that manufacturing industries are beginning
__label__news beginning to turn to support for it because they rsquo re being undermined by the hopelessly inefficient u s healthcare system
__label__news system it rsquo s the worst in the industrial world by far and they have to pay for it since it
__label__news it rsquo s employer compensated in part their production costs are much higher than those competitors who have a national healthcare
__label__news healthcare system take gm if it produces the same car in detroit and in windsor across the border in canada it
__label__news it saves i forget the number i think over with the windsor production because there rsquo s a national healthcare system
__label__news system it rsquo s much more efficient it rsquo s much cheaper it rsquo s much more effective so the manufacturing
__label__news manufacturing industry is starting to press for some kind of national healthcare now it rsquo s beginning to put it on
__label__news on the agenda it doesn rsquo t matter if the population wants it what of the population wants would be kind
__label__news kind of irrelevant but if part of the concentration of corporate capital that basically runs the country another thing we rsquo
__label__news rsquo re not allowed to say but it rsquo s obvious if part of that sector becomes in favor then the
__label__news the issue moves onto the political agenda shank so how does the south get its voice heard on the international agenda
__label__news agenda is the world social forum a place for it chomsky the world social forum is very important but of course
__label__news course that can rsquo t be covered in the west in fact i remember reading an article i think in the
__label__news the financial times about the two major forums that were taking place one was the world economic forum in davos and
__label__news and a second was a forum in herzeliyah in israel a right wing forum in herzeliyah those were the two forums
__label__news forums of course there was also the world social forum in nairobi but that rsquo s only tens of thousands of
__label__news of people from around the world shank with the trend towards vilifying the g at the un one wonders where the
__label__news the developing world can effectively voice their concerns chomsky the developing world voice can be amplified enormously by support from the
__label__news the wealthy and the privileged otherwise it rsquo s very likely to be marginalized as in every other issue shank so
__label__news so it rsquo s up to us foreign policy in focus contributor michael shank is the policy director for the d

__label__news such an attack would be effective or even possible rdquo a british defence source confirmed that there were deep misgivings inside
__label__news inside the pentagon about a military strike ldquo all the generals are perfectly clear that they don rsquo t have the
__label__news the military capacity to take iran on in any meaningful fashion nobody wants to do it and it would be a

__label__news iran he played down claims by us intelligence that the iranian government was responsible for supplying insurgents in iraq forcing bush
__label__news bush on the defensive pace rsquo s view was backed up by british intelligence officials who said the extent of the

__label__news general michael moseley the head of the air force cited iran as the main likely target for american aircraft at a
__label__news a military conference earlier this according to a report in the new yorker magazine the pentagon has already set up a
__label__news a working group to plan airstrikes on iran the panel initially focused on destroying iran rsquo s nuclear facilities and on
__label__news on regime change but has more recently been instructed to identify targets in iran that may be involved in supplying or
__label__news or aiding militants in iraq however army chiefs fear an attack on iran would backfire on american troops in iraq and
__label__news and lead to more terrorist attacks a rise in oil prices and the threat of a regional war britain is concerned
__label__news concerned that its own troops in iraq might be drawn into any american conflict with iran regardless of whether the government

__label__news insist there is no cause for alarm but ordinary people are now becoming a little worried she says deadline earlier this
__label__news this us officers in iraq said they had evidence iran was providing weapons to iraqi shia militias however the most senior
__label__news senior us military officer later cast doubt on this saying that they only had proof that weapons made in iran were
__label__news were being used in iraq gen peter pace chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said he did not know that
__label__news that the iranian government clearly knows or is complicit in this at the time iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said the accusations

__label__news of catastrophic consequences for any such us attack on iran britain s previous ambassador to tehran sir richard dalton told the
__label__news the bbc it would backfire badly by probably encouraging the iranian government to develop a nuclear weapon in the long term

__label__news its middle east strategy the ldquo redirection rdquo as some inside the white house have called the new strategy has brought
__label__news brought the united states closer to an open confrontation with iran and in parts of the region propelled it into a
__label__news a widening sectarian conflict between shiite and sunni muslims to undermine iran which is predominantly shiite the bush administration has decided
__label__news decided in effect to reconfigure its priorities in the middle east in lebanon the administration has co ouml perated with saudi
__label__news saudi arabia rsquo s government which is sunni in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken hezbollah the shiite organization that
__label__news that is backed by iran the u s has also taken part in clandestine operations aimed at iran and its ally
__label__news ally syria a by product of these activities has been the bolstering of sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision
__label__news vision of islam and are hostile to america and sympathetic to al qaeda one contradictory aspect of the new strategy is
__label__news is that in iraq most of the insurgent violence directed at the american military has come from sunni forces and not
__label__news not from shiites but from the administration rsquo s perspective the most profound mdash and unintended mdash strategic consequence of the
__label__news the iraq war is the empowerment of iran its president mahmoud ahmadinejad has made defiant pronouncements about the destruction of israel
__label__news israel and his country rsquo s right to pursue its nuclear program and last week its supreme religious leader ayatollah ali
__label__news ali khamenei said on state television that ldquo realities in the region show that the arrogant front headed by the u
__label__news u s and its allies will be the principal loser in the region rdquo after the revolution of brought a religious
__label__news religious government to power the united states broke with iran and cultivated closer relations with the leaders of sunni arab states
__label__news states such as jordan egypt and saudi arabia that calculation became more complex after the september th attacks especially with regard
__label__news regard to the saudis al qaeda is sunni and many of its operatives came from extremist religious circles inside saudi arabia
__label__news arabia before the invasion of iraq in administration officials influenced by neoconservative ideologues assumed that a shiite government there could provide
__label__news provide a pro american balance to sunni extremists since iraq rsquo s shiite majority had been oppressed under saddam hussein they
__label__news they ignored warnings from the intelligence community about the ties between iraqi shiite leaders and iran where some had lived in
__label__news in exile for years now to the distress of the white house iran has forged a close relationship with the shiite
__label__news shiite dominated government of prime minister nuri al maliki the new american policy in its broad outlines has been discussed publicly
__label__news publicly in testimony before the senate foreign relations committee in january secretary of state condoleezza rice said that there is ldquo
__label__news ldquo a new strategic alignment in the middle east rdquo separating ldquo reformers rdquo and ldquo extremists rdquo she pointed to
__label__news to the sunni states as centers of moderation and said that iran syria and hezbollah were ldquo on the other side
__label__news side of that divide rdquo syria rsquo s sunni majority is dominated by the alawi sect iran and syria she said
__label__news said ldquo have made their choice and their choice is to destabilize rdquo some of the core tactics of the redirection
__label__news redirection are not public however the clandestine operations have been kept secret in some cases by leaving the execution or the

__label__news symbolize to the people of the world no more hiroshimas as years passed however the ruin has deteriorated further due to
__label__news to winds and rain a civic movement was started calling for permanent preservation of the a bomb dome and money was
__label__news was contributed from all over japan not to mention from hiroshima within a year after the fund raising campaign was started
__label__news started the restoration funds had been collected in august the reinforcing construction was completed that is why the present a bomb
__label__news bomb dome gives a different impression from that in the photograph the bridge located to the south the other side of
__label__news of the dome is motoyasu bridge and the area to the west right of the bridge is the present peace park
__label__news park the hill a little right from the center is ninoshima called small mt fuji which is about kilometers from the

__label__news right and beyond is the center of hiroshima city and the raging fire is creeping up both ends of this bridge
__label__news bridge which was the longest one in hiroshima at that time were filled with a bomb victims many of them were

__label__news can and started to give first aid treatment to the people with burns but the number of the injured increased rapidly
__label__news rapidly i thought this must be photographed and held the camera in position the scene isaw through the finder was too
__label__news too cruel among the hundreds of injured persons of whom you cannnot tell the difference between male and female there were
__label__news were children screaming it s hot it s hot and infants crying over the body of their mother who appeared to
__label__news to be already dead i tried to pull myself together by telling myself that i m a news cameraman and it
__label__news it is my duty and privilege to take a photograph even if it is just one and even if people take
__label__news take me as a devil or a cold hearted man i finally managed to press the shutter but when i looked
__label__news looked the finder for the second time the object was blurred by tears because of the atomic bombing there were no
__label__news no newspaper reports in hiroshima for august th and th of the the hiroshima tokuho the phantom newspaper was published on
__label__news on august faithfully reflecting the feeling of that time based on the news collected by three reporters and a cameraman who
__label__news who heated toward the hypocenter immediately after the detonation of the a bomb year old camphor tree uprooted by the blast
__label__news blast in the precincts of the kokutaiji temple the big camphor tree said to be over years old was designated as
__label__news as a natural monument its branches and thick leaves provided a place of comfort for the passers by during summertime its
__label__news its roots spread out in all directions for meters and the street car lines shown on the left in the photograph
__label__news photograph had to avoid the tree which formed an archway over the sidewalk by a blast pressure of tons per square
__label__news square meter the tree was uprooted also hundreds of tombstones were knocked in all directions by the complex flow of wind
__label__news wind from the blast the white building seen on the extreme right is the hiroshima branch of the bank of japan
__label__news japan because it was built of strong ferro concrete and stonework the exterior remained uncollapsed but the interior burned a building
__label__news building brought to knees by the blast this was a clock store located in hiroshima s central business quarters called the
__label__news the hondori which is still a bustling street the upper part was the clock tower which had been telling the time
__label__news time to passers by until the explosion the first floor shown in the photograph was the second floor this two storied
__label__news storied building was of a strusture like a match box with no central pillar so when it received the blast pressure
__label__news pressure from the side the first floor was crushed and the building sank into itself hence the second floor became the
__label__news the first floor and the building leaned toward the side away from of the blast there were many buildings of ferro
__label__news ferro concrete structure in hiroshima mostly in the vicinity of the hypocenter according to a survey these durable buildings were only
__label__news only destroyed if they were within meters of the hypocenter buildings of earthquake proof construction were damaged only on the inside
__label__news inside however many buildings situated beyond meters were essentially destroyed too as in the case of this clock store situated farther
__label__news farther than meters disaster near the hypocenter around the matsuyama cho intersection which is close to the hypocenter victimswere burned to
__label__news to death in their last gesture grasping at the air or trying to escape everything that burns was burnt roof tiles
__label__news tiles were crushed into small pieces and scattered all over air raid shelters and street cars were burned and ruined all
__label__news all tell the miserable story without words in the record of the nagasaki a bomb war disaster the situation in matsuyama
__label__news matsuyama township is described as s a huge fireball formed in the sky directly beneath it is matsuyama township together with
__label__news with the flash came the heat rays and blast which instantly destroyed everything on earth and those in the area fell
__label__news fell unconscious and were crushed to death then they were blown up in the air and hurled back to the ground
__label__news ground the roaring flames burned those caught under the structures who were crying or groaning for help when the fire burnt
__label__news burnt itself out there appeared a completely changed vast colorless world that made you think it was the end of life
__label__news life on earth in a heap of ashes lay the debris of the disaster and charred trees presenting a gruesome scene
__label__news scene the whole city became extinct citizens who were in matsuyama township the hypocenter were all killed instantly excepting a child
__label__news child who was in an air raid shelter the urakami cathedral destroyed in an instant the cathedral collapsed at the burst
__label__news burst of the a bomb and scores cf believers died sharing the same fate then fire broke out it is said
__label__news said that the remains of the cathedral continued to further collapse with eerie thuds even after dark it is also said
__label__news said that there were believers in urakami at the time of the bombing and were killed by the a bomb in
__label__news in the ruins of the cathedlal there were many stone statues of the saints in the heaps of broken bricks and
__label__news and stones the photograph shows part of the outer wall of the south entrance where the statues of the holy mother
__label__news mother and saint john lie chat red by the heat rays also the shadow in the lower left of the photograph
__label__news photograph shows that the largest twin tower in the orient fully received the blast and was shifted centimeters from the foundation
__label__news foundation stone the building of this cathedral began in and it took years to be completed in urakami a village then
__label__news then where the believers have kept their faith since christianity was introduced to japan and even through the years of the
__label__news the edo period when christianity was prohibited the building employed the romanesque style using stones and bricks this cathedral had a
__label__news a floor space of sq meters and tower meters high the current ltr akami cathedral was built in part of the
__label__news the destroyed cathedral is preserved at the hypocenter a factory destroyed by the blast the steel framework of this factory was
__label__news was broken and bent in a mess as if it were made from a pliable material the concrete base supporting the
__label__news the steel frame was shoved by the blast this is testament to how frightful the blast pressure was it is d
__label__news d that this factory was subjected to a wind velocity of meters per second arid a wind pressure of tons per
__label__news per square meter until the very moment of the explosion there was an array of machine tools in the factory and
__label__news and a number of overhead cranes were busily operating most of the workers were crushed to death on august it is
__label__news is recorded that persons came to work among whom died and were seriously injured the rate of casualties was a worker
__label__news worker who miraculously kept his life said i was talking about work with my colleague but in a moment he was
__label__news was killed instantly by a crane which crushed half of his body it was a shocking sight and a horrible way
__label__news way to die his head was smashed his belly torn and his bowels ballooned this photograph shows where many such tragedies
__label__news tragedies took place shiroyama primary school leveled by the blast shiroyalna primary school is the primary school nearest to the hypocenter
__label__news hypocenter built on a hill surrounded by beautiful woods this was the most modern ferro concreate school building in nagasaki the
__label__news the shiroyama township was a neathly planned quite residential district but with one flash of the a bomb the school homes
__label__news homes and the woods were reduced to rubble according to the records of april this school had classrooms pupils and teachers
__label__news teachers and staffs since an air raid alert was announced on that day the pupils were s nt home those who
__label__news who remained were teachers including a child of one of the teachers students of the gakuto hokokutai and workers from the
__label__news the mitsubishi heiki seisakusho a total of persons of the persons were instantly killed by the heat rays and the enormous
__label__news enormous wind pressure and died later a total of victims accounts for a death rate of of the pupils who were
__label__news were at a home it is d that about were killed the heat rays burned the clothing pattern onto the skin
__label__news skin a woman s back burned by the strong heat rays though it is unknown at what distance from the hypocenter
__label__news hypocenter these two women were the left photograph was taken at the army hospital ujina blanch in the southern part of
__label__news of hiroshima city and the right photograph at the army quarantines on ninoshima island hiroshima bay the photograph on the right
__label__news right shows the dark portion of the pattern of the clothing imprinted on the skin by the powerful heat rays this
__label__news this is also called secondary burns ins which the skin under the clothing received burns through the clothes scorched by the
__label__news the heat rays the photograph on the right shows a woman who must have been exposed to the a bomb less
__label__news less than kilometers from the hypocenter judging by the extent of the burns on her entire back though the affected part
__label__news part was medically treated you can see that the degree of the burns differs according to the angle at which the
__label__news the heat rays were received the burns on the left shoulder are most severe and the burns on the right shoulder
__label__news shoulder to the waist are relatively light ninoshima island where this woman was evacuated to is situated about kilometers south of
__label__news of ujina port it has a circumference of about kilometers on this island there were several facilities including the army quarantines
__label__news quarantines these facilities became emergency first aid stations and it is d that roughly victims of the a bomb were transported
__label__news transported to this island by boat over people breathed their last here keloids of a person km away from the hypocenter
__label__news hypocenter the date of this photograph is unknown but there are records indicating that it was taken in october and the
__label__news the patient was years old then although the portion covered by the shoulder strap of a bag was left lmburned traces
__label__news traces of burns on the patient s back can be seen since the patient had light clothes on at that time
__label__news time heavy keloids started to show on both arms which were exfn sea the cause of keloids is not clear yet
__label__news yet but it is consideretd to be caused by a combination of powerful heat rays and radiation according to an observation
__label__news observation record containing entries a clinical examination showing the sequence of protrusion from skin surface tone of color contraction of skin
__label__news skin described the tramsition as s december protrusion started red contracted may protrusion becomes most noticeable red excessively contracted july partial
__label__news partial flattening occurred reddish purple contraction continues but also some wrinkles october light keloids flattened purple color on contraction somewhat eases
__label__news eases january heavy keloids shrink and wrinkles increase purplish blue wrinkles occur thermal rays leave human shadow on stone steps shadow
__label__news shadow of handrail the left photograph shows the stone steps of the main entrandce of sumitomo bank which is only meters
__label__news meters from the hypocenter it is believed that a person sat down on the steps facing the direction of the hypocenter
__label__news hypocenter possibly waiting for the bank to open by a flash of the heat rays with temperatures well over a degrees
__label__news degrees or possibly degrees centigrade that person was incineratied on the stone steps up to about years after the explosion the
__label__news the shadow remained clearly on the stones but exposure to rain and wind has been gradually blurring it so when the
__label__news the bank was newly built the stone steps were removed and are now preserved at the hiroshima peace memorial museum the
__label__news the right photograph shows the shadow made by the heat rays this place is about meters from the hypocenter and the
__label__news the unshielded asphalt surface was scorched whereas the surface shielded by the handrail appears to be a whitish shadow the peculiarity
__label__news peculiarity characterizing the heat rays from the a bomb is that an enormous amount of heat is emitted in a short
__label__news short time for seconds after the explosion the thermal loss by heat conductivity is very little because of the short time
__label__news time and consequently the surface temperature of a material becomes very high within a kilometer radius of the hypocenter there were
__label__news were many instances where the roof tiles melted and left bubbles a boy who received radiation burns on his whole body
__label__news body this boy had thermal burns on more than one third of his body and his chest and the left side
__label__news side of his belly were seriously injured he managed to leave the hospital after years and s this person who miraculously
__label__news miraculously recovered is now a father of two children and recollects what happened then at that time i was riding a
__label__news a red bibycle on the streets of sumiyoshi township about kilometers from the hypocenter i was years old and it was
__label__news was my second year as a telegram messenger the moment of face i was blinded by the flash and thrown meters
__label__news meters away by the blast that came from my rear left and my bicycle was twisted and bent it was strange
__label__news strange that i was not bleeding and did not feel any pain until i reached an underground shelter meters away the
__label__news the moment i reached the shelter i felt severe pain in my back which ran through my whole body from then
__label__news then on for three days and three nights i kept on groaning in the shelter and on the fourth day i
__label__news i was finally rescued and sent to a first aid station in the early stages the only treatment i received for
__label__news for my burns was the application of a mixture of ash and oil as a substitute for medicine i do not
__label__news not know how many times i yelled kill me because of the severe pain and desperate feeling thereafter as a result
__label__news result of the several operations i underwent i escaped death and returned to work since i have once given up my
__label__news my life i wish to dedicatemy new life to the struggle against atomic bombs he is continuing to devote his efforts
__label__news efforts to the prohibiton of atomic and hydrogen bombs the burned corpse of a boy this boy who was burned to
__label__news to death with his hands placed on his chest leaving an impression of agony is believed to have been a mobilized
__label__news mobilized student exposed to the a bomb in iwakana township which is about meters from the hypocenter in those days students
__label__news students who were in the th or th grade or in middle school were mobilized to munitions factories farms and national
__label__news national defense crews they hardly did any learning at school in the urakami district of nagasaki there were several factories including
__label__news including the mitsubishi munitions to which many students were mobilized the death toll of mobilized students is unknown regarding the disaster
__label__news disaster in iwakawa township where this student was burned to death the record of the nagasaki a bomb war disaster reads
__label__news reads as s the instant the a bomb exploded almost all of the houses collapsed the scattered pieces of wood and
__label__news and other debris covered the ground and in some places they were heaped into drifts those who were outdoors all died
__label__news died and those who were caught under the collapsed houses were screaming for help and those who barely escaped frantically ran
__label__news ran around the town got dark and when visibility was regained the collapsed houses started to smolder and then took fire
__label__news fire while there were mixed outcries of calls and for help the town turned into a sea of flames streetcars and
__label__news and passengers blown away the urakami district the northern part of nagasaki city was originally a quiet residential area but from
__label__news from around the time of the japan china war munition factories were constructed one aftere another the streetcars transported factory workers
__label__news workers and mobilized students to the factory area from the center part of nagasaki city this photograph shows a streetcar that
__label__news that was blown away from the shimonokawa car stop while it was heading for the ohashi terminal two stops away the
__label__news the corpses of passengers were blown from the streetcar to a stone wall most of them were soldiers of the nd
__label__news nd company of special guards on the way to the municipal commercial school where their defensive position was this streetcar was
__label__news was only meters from the hypocenter and was destroyed to the extent that none of its original shape remained after unimaginable
__label__news unimaginable pressure of that blast from the upper right the soldiers and other passengers on the streetcar instantly succumbed to the
__label__news the blast and the heat the black portions of the corpse which are actually dark red are burns from the heat
__label__news heat rays currently this spot is a railway crossing that separates the peace park from national highway where the streetcar line
__label__news line and the national railway line run parallel on a lower level to the national highway after the war the shimonokawa
__label__news shimonokawa car stop was no longer used but the curbstone of the car stop still carries the traces of the burn
__label__news burn the place shown in the photograph is now a parking lot and by the sidewalk along the national highway above
__label__news above the stone wall there are two monuments to the memory of the a bomb vicim in between is a monument
__label__news monument for those victims who had no surviving relatives offerings of flowers to these monuments never cease subcutaneous hemorrhage atomic bomb

__label__news kilometer from the hypocenter since he was indoors he was saved from burns but as he received cuts on his buck
__label__news buck right elvow and right belly first aid treatment was given to him however when we his medical record we learn
__label__news learn more august hair falling out is noticed august bleeding from gum and purplish subcutaneous hemorrhage starts to appear as in
__label__news in the photograph august is hospitalized in the ujina branch of the army hospital and on the st becomes feverish september
__label__news september tonsillitis occurs and with a sore throat he can not eat bleeding from gum dose not stop and subcutaneous hemorrhage
__label__news hemorrhage multiplies on face and upper half of body september has an indistinct consciousness and starts to talk in delirium september
__label__news september died at p m this photograph was taken hours before his death at the request of an american army surgeon
__label__news surgeon this soldier s symton record is a typical description of the acute effects of radiation the right photograph shows an
__label__news an eyeball of an a bomb victim who got an atomic bomb cataract there is opacity near the center of the
__label__news the eyeball it has been known for some time through that radiation causes cataracts in animals but cataracts developed in human
__label__news human beings after the atomic bombings in hiroshima and nagasaki according to a clinical report of cataract cases in hiroshima during
__label__news during the four years from had atomic bomb cataracts or suspected atomic bomb cataracts it is reported that of those were
__label__news were within kilometer from the hypocenter and were within kilometers some atomic bomb cataracts occurred several s after exposure while most
__label__news most occurred several years later in the case of this patient it was diagnosed as an atomic bomb cataract in years
__label__news years after the bomb the patient filed an application with the ministry of health and welfare of the japanese government in
__label__news in august so as to be registered as an a bomb victim his application was turned down because it is not
__label__news not considered necessary that you be medically treated now the patient filed the second and third application in august and november
__label__news november of the second one was turned down and he was told to apply anew at the time was commenced the
__label__news the third one was turned down with a reply saying submit application at the time of operation so the patient had
__label__news had no other choice but to sue the government and ministry of health and welfare in may after years in court
__label__news court the patient s request was finally approved in july a girl s epilation caused by acute radiation effects this girl
__label__news girl years old was on the second floor of a wooden house which was situated kilometers from the hypocenter since she
__label__news she was indoors she did not receive any burns but about a week later epilation started she suffered from loss of
__label__news of appetite bleeding from the gum and fever she was recovered a little when this photograph was taken epilation is a
__label__news a characteristic external sympton of exposure to radiation it can occur as early as or days after exposure but in most
__label__news most instances the hair loss commenced in the second or third week fever begins a few days after the start of

__label__news mankind between survival and eradication we live in the age of nuclear horror whether we like it or not therefore in
__label__news in order to make our own lives secure and to ensure the perpetuation of mankind we must abolish all nuclear weapons
__label__news weapons from the earth japan is in the forefront of this drive for peace the movement against nuclear weapons originated with

__label__news message was brought into full play in the first world conference against a and h bombs held in august a global
__label__news global movement calling for the extinction of nuclear weapons was spearheaded by an organization called ngo and by the nonaligned neutral

__label__news agreement be made to protect non nuclear countries nuclear weapons must not be deployed in non nuclear countries nuclear tests must
__label__news must not be conducted an investigation must be made so as to terminate the production of nuclear weapons and nuclear test
__label__news test equipment the above recommendation have not been fully carried out therefore it is necessary to mobilize public opinion all over
__label__news over the world endeavours for peace should be strengthened so that the second u n special session on disarmament to be
__label__news be held in will be much more successful the devil s weapon made by man must be removed by the wisdom
__label__news wisdom of man we must strengthen our belief with one another and define what we can do now and what we
__label__news we must do now we must gather each and everyone s efforts into one big force for the abolition of nuclear
__label__news nuclear weapons in order to secure eternal surbibal prosperity and peace for all mankind all right no more excuses people after
__label__news after four years in iraq its time to get serious weve spent too long goofing off waiting to be saved by
__label__news by the bell praying that we wont get asked a stumper like whats the difference between a sunni and a shiite
__label__news shiite okay even the head of the house intelligence committee doesnt know that one all the more reason to start boning
__label__news boning up on what weand our leadersshould have learned back before they signed us up for this crash course in middle
__label__news middle eastern geopolitics and while were at it lets do the math on what the war really costs in blood and
__label__news and dollars its time for our own iraq study group yes there will be a test and we cant afford to
__label__news to fail iran ready to attack american preparations for invading iran are complete dan plesch reveals plus rageh omaar s insights
__label__news insights from iran and andrew stephen on fears george bush s administration will blunder into war american military operations for a
__label__news a major conventional war with iran could be implemented any day they extend far beyond targeting suspect wmd facilities and will
__label__news will enable president bush to destroy iran s military political and economic infrastructure overnight using conventional weapons british military sources told
__label__news told the new statesman on condition of anonymity that the us military switched its whole focus to iran as soon as
__label__news as saddam hussein was kicked out of baghdad it continued this strategy even though it had american infantry bogged down in
__label__news in fighting the insurgency in iraq the us army navy air force and marines have all prepared battle plans and spent
__label__news spent four years building bases and training for operation iranian freedom admiral fallon the new head of us central command has
__label__news has inherited computerised plans under the name tirannt theatre iran near term the bush administration has made much of sending a
__label__news a second aircraft carrier to the gulf but it is a tiny part of the preparations post the us navy can
__label__news can put six carriers into battle at a s notice two carriers in the region the uss john c stennis and
__label__news and the uss dwight d eisenhower could quickly be joined by three more now at sea uss ronald reagan uss harry
__label__news harry s truman and uss theodore roosevelt as well as by uss nimitz each carrier force includes hundreds of cruise missiles
__label__news missiles then there are the marines who are not tied down fighting in iraq several marine forces are assembling each with
__label__news with its own aircraft carrier these carrier forces can each conduct a version of the d day landings they come with
__label__news with landing craft tanks jump jets thousands of troops and yes hundreds more cruise missiles their task is to destroy iranian
__label__news iranian forces able to attack oil tankers and to secure oilfields and installations they have trained for this mission since the
__label__news the iranian revolution of today marines have the uss boxer and uss bataan carrier forces in the gulf and probably also
__label__news also the uss kearsarge and uss bonhomme richard three others the uss peleliu uss wasp and uss iwo jima are ready
__label__news ready to join them earlier this year hq staff to manage these forces were moved from virginia to bahrain vice president
__label__news president dick cheney has had something of a love affair with the us marines and this may reach its culmination in
__label__news in the fishing villages along iran s gulf coast marine generals hold the top jobs at nato in the pentagon and
__label__news and are in charge of all nuclear weapons no marine has held any of these posts before traditionally the top nuclear
__label__news nuclear job went either to a commander of the navy s trident submarines or of the air force s bombers and
__label__news and missiles today all these forces the orders of a marine general james cartwright and are integrated into a global strike
__label__news strike plan which places strategic forces on permanent hour readiness the only public discussion of this plan has been by the
__label__news the american analysts bill arkin and hans kristensen who have focused on the possible use of atomic weapons these concerns are
__label__news are justified but ignore how forces can be used in conventional war any us general planning to attack iran can now
__label__news now assume that at least targets can be hit in a single raid with warplanes flying from the us or diego
__label__news diego garcia in the past year unlimited funding for military technology has taken smart bombs to a new level new bunker
__label__news bunker busting conventional bombs weigh only lb according to boeing the gbu small diameter bomb quadruples the firepower of us warplanes
__label__news warplanes compared to those in use even as recently as a single stealth or b bomber can now attack between and
__label__news and individual points to within a metre of accuracy using the global positioning system with little military effort the us air
__label__news air force can hit the last known position of iranian military units political leaders and supposed sites of weapons of mass
__label__news mass destruction one can be sure that if war comes george bush will not want to stand accused of using too
__label__news too little force and allowing iran to fight back global strike means that without any obvious signal what was done to
__label__news to serbia and lebanon can be done overnight to the whole of iran we and probably the iranians would not know
__label__news know about it until after the bombs fell forces that hide will suffer the fate of saddam s armies once their
__label__news their positions are known the whole of iran is now less than an hour s flying time from some american base
__label__news base or carrier sources in the region as well as trade journals confirm that the us has built three bases in
__label__news in azerbaijan that could be transit points for troops and with facilities equal to its best in europe most of the
__label__news the iranian army is positioned along the border with iraq facing us army missiles that can reach km over the border
__label__news border but it is in the flat sandy oilfields east and south of basra where the temptation will be to launch
__label__news launch a tank attack and hope that a disaffected population will be grateful the regime in tehran has already complained of
__label__news of us and uk inspired terror attacks in several iranian regions where the population opposes the ayatollahs fanatical policies such reports
__label__news reports corroborate the american journalist seymour hersh s claim that the us military is already engaged in a low level war
__label__news war with iran the fighting is most intense in the kurdish north where iran has been firing artillery into iraq the
__label__news the us and iran are already engaged in a low level proxy war across the iran iraq border and once again
__label__news again the neo cons at the american enterprise institute have a plan for a peaceful settlement this time it is for
__label__news for a federal iran officially michael ledeen the aei plan s sponsor has been ostracised by the white house however two
__label__news two years ago the congress of iranian nationalities for a federal iran had its inaugural meeting in london we should not
__label__news not the bush administration s ability to convince itself that an iran of the regions will emerge from a post rubble
__label__news rubble iran dan plesch is a research associate at the school of oriental and african studies articles from this issue on
__label__news on iran this mr president is how wars start by andrew stephen sheer incompetence could be the trigger we are asking
__label__news asking the wrong questions of iran by rageh omaar rageh omaar finds a country more complex than most in the west
__label__news west have ever realised the media says the u s has inflicted up to deaths upon the iraqi people in the
__label__news the last three years and still they manage to give the impression that we are being routed by the enemy i
__label__news i read that insurgents are being sent in from iran syria saudi arabia and elsewhere to prevent the elected government of
__label__news of iraq from becoming stable then i m told it s a civil war the myth of bias free news reporting
__label__news reporting has to be debunked and the consumer has to be aware that today it is impossible to get news that
__label__news that is not filtered through the political agenda of the source that is reporting it whether it is pro american fox
__label__news fox news or anti american cnn reporting the facts will be skewed i believe it is possible that iraq was invaded
__label__news invaded to provide a base of operations for a war with iran saddam s army demonstrated it s lack of prowess
__label__news prowess in both gulf wars maybe the u s believes that if you want something done right do it yourself the
__label__news the dan plesch would have us believe that the u s military is not to be taken lightly others in the
__label__news the media make us doubt this doubt is demonstrated by pimpa s comment on feb that the military might of the
__label__news the u s does not exist it is only pentagon propaganda meant to frighten iranians he asks who believes all this
__label__news this saddam believes but does anyone else report this comment charlieusmc february the consensus seems to be that the u s
__label__news s is getting a good whipping in iraq and if we pick a fight with iran it will be more of
__label__news of the same if you consider completely devastating a country obliterating their military and deposing and hanging their president taking a
__label__news a beating get into rehab if iran has the same success against the u s that iraq has i m not
__label__news not sure they re looking forward to it iran may give the u s a bloody nose but if they wind
__label__news wind up in intensive care on life support does that still count as a win the poor and needy in middle
__label__news middle east africa afghanistan and places like that would this not have taken any reason out of the hands of hard
__label__news hard line muslims and even the iranian government to wage war against us in the west this would have undermined the
__label__news the strength which people like osama bin laden command and they would therefore no longer have any ers instead we appear
__label__news appear to be helping their cause by accepting their argument that there is war zionist colonial expansion if it us army
__label__news army to do its dirty deeds the better it matters not is a goim dies on behalf of erez israel life
__label__news life of a non jew never mattered to them the neocons in washington expected to have a quick walk over iraq
__label__news iraq on its way to syria and never expected to get such a bloody nose in the process iran is making
__label__news making anti zionists noises well hit them hard so others will know better if it us again paying and dying in
__label__news in iran know why russia and china were conducting joint military exercises in and for stuff like this that axis wants
__label__news wants to suck our economy and military personnel dry and the satanic treasonous neocons are obliging all neocons and their sponsors
__label__news sponsors must be purged period they clearly haven t learned from history iran does not have nuclear weapons nobody is trying
__label__news trying to claim that they do what iran has is a nuclear power plant and the facilities to make fuel rods
__label__news rods for that nuclear power plant the iaea has been inspecting all aspects of the iranian facilities and has closed circuit
__label__news circuit tv cameras watching them at all times more importantly iran has a legal right to nuclear power plants and the
__label__news the systems to make fuel rods for them under the nuclear non proliferation treaty which the united states and iran have
__label__news have both signed in seeking to deny iran the right to nuclear power generation it is the united states which is
__label__news is violating a key treaty but let us suppose for a moment that iran has a nuclear weapon they still would
__label__news would not be a threat to the united states because the united states still maintains the largest nuclear force in the
__label__news the world just one ohio class submarine could destroy every key city in iran iran knows this so iran is not
__label__news not a danger to the united states not unless the us government wants to admit is wasted all those trillions of
__label__news of dollars building a nuclear deterrent which isn t a deterrent so as was the case in iraq bush is invading
__label__news invading iran supposedly because of a non existent threat of course we all know the real reason iran is being invaded
__label__news invaded because israel has ordered it based on the securing the realm document by key bush advisers not for the us
__label__news us but for israel our kids are being killed and crippled our wallets are being emptied our infrastructure being allowed to
__label__news to decay all in service to a foreign government that openly bribes our politicians and screams anti semite at those who
__label__news who dare point to the bribery as contrary to american needs and interests please think about this in the s between
__label__news between now and the elections all americans want to stop iran from developing nuclear weapons and interfering on the ground inside
__label__news inside iraq yet president bush s saber rattling gives the us little additional leverage to engage and dissuade iran and more
__label__news more than likely simply accelerates a dangerous slide into war the united states can do better than this whatever the pace
__label__news pace of iran s nuclear efforts in the give and take of the administration s rhetoric and accusations we are approaching
__label__news approaching the last moments to head off looming conflict cannot the world s most powerful nation deign speak to the resentful
__label__news resentful and scheming regional power that is iran can we not speak of the interests of others work to establish a
__label__news a sustained dialogue and seek to benefit the people of iran and the region could not such a dialogue properly conducted
__label__news conducted begin a process that could over time help realign hardened attitudes and polarizing views within the region and isn t
__label__news t it easier to undertake such a dialogue now before more die and more martyrs are created to feed extremist passions
__label__news passions please join the iraq war veterans at votevets org and me and sign the petition to president bush today military
__label__news military force against iran is not the solution now and if we adopt the right strategy perhaps it need never be
__label__news be urge him to work with our allies and use every diplomatic political and economic option at our disposal to deal

__label__news the tamils even to hamas and hezbollah our clinical term is ldquo non state actor rdquo living in a world of
__label__news of ldquo ungoverned areas rdquo as though their local governance is ldquo unrule rdquo their living communities ldquo unsocieties rdquo they
__label__news they are merely human black holes to be mopped up and shut down we see only our labels of cool acronym
__label__news acronym and hot ldquo terrorist rdquo superficially this may look a bit like cold war days when every ldquo liberation movement
__label__news movement rdquo set off ldquo communist rdquo klaxons but this is not then back then the dark force was the soviet
__label__news soviet union third world seducer the real cold war analogy is in the soviet metaphor itself thus the ldquo islamo fascist
__label__news fascist rdquo threat equals the soviet threat requiring an equivalent struggle but unlike the cold war our survival now depends not
__label__news not on deterrence but on destruction this story has remarkable implications for alternative communities our islamofascist branding makes every movement of
__label__news of muslim resistance an attack on us yet most resistance instead speaks to local yearnings by seeing an enemy of civilization
__label__news civilization in every muslim non state actor we unthinkingly widen the struggle alternative communities are indelible in the ldquo evil rdquo
__label__news rdquo world landscape painted by the global war on terrorism the ongoing metamorphosis of the global other into the mordor of
__label__news of our imagination then there are meta communities of piety modernity rsquo s greatest failure is spiritual neon lit in europe
__label__news europe where old piety has crashed and burned but among the global other scorched by modernity rsquo s ldquo creative destruction
__label__news destruction rdquo it is not that people have abandoned piety but that it has abandoned them in globalization rsquo s mixing
__label__news mixing bowl the meditative power of old ethos has been lost yet american modernity offers nothing to take its place just
__label__news just ask an afghani or an iraqi piety is a cry for meaning in a stripped world two movements stand out
__label__news out the pentecostalist and the islamist both share a deep repudiation of the western nation state as the supreme human ideal
__label__news ideal not because they are intrinsically anti western but because they see modernity as antithetical to what people need if this
__label__news this seems harsh just feel the fervor and the fulfillment they offer calling them throwbacks from a primitive past denies what
__label__news what we need to see that modernity itself has been stripping not giving denial robs us of insight into what people
__label__news people need while calling their piety ldquo primitive rdquo encourages us to see the global other as a lesser humanity we
__label__news we have after all declared that the lowest bar we will accept for muslims is ldquo moderate islam rdquo where we
__label__news we will ratify what is correct like american modernity romans also presided over a humanity left behind a welter of cults
__label__news cults jostling in the social and spiritual vacuum romans also proscribed resister cults defining christians the way we define terrorists as
__label__news as threats to civilization yet then as now the spiritual alternatives people sought could not be controlled the great success stories
__label__news stories then were christianity and islam today rsquo s evangelists reach back to their passionate origins the martyrs of the early
__label__news early church and al ansar the brotherhood of muhammad we fear to face the passionate fusion of alternative community and transcendental
__label__news transcendental faith because the prospect of true meta communities of piety leverages and multiplies the energies of local resistance in modernity
__label__news modernity rsquo s youth those who resisted simply ended up as notches on history rsquo s belt the fate of all
__label__news all who stand in the way of progress what is different today is that resistance grows everywhere in the face of
__label__news of modernity rsquo s ldquo power rdquo they are fighters and they know how to beat us ideas visions and sacrifice
__label__news sacrifice meant nothing in the victorian face of the maxim gun but our grand war narrative has endowed a counter narrative
__label__news narrative of resistance the great muslim war showcases this achievement creating dramatic stagings that we cannot win and that paradoxically become
__label__news become the gift of transcendence to our enemy witness iraq afghanistan and southern lebanon botched stagings pressure local tyrant allies saudi
__label__news saudi princes pakistani generals and egyptian pharaohs we find ourselves scrambling to prop them up visibly giving the lie to our
__label__news our public values remarkably our war story makes its sacred centerpiece modernity look backward and repressive we declare that ldquo resistance
__label__news resistance is futile rdquo yet the opposite is true the bigger we make the enemy the bigger they become ours is
__label__news is the complicity of backhand legitimization whether we admit this or shout the reverse effectively our war narrative works to set
__label__news set up superpower defeat even if at first it seems only a drama of defeat played out in the media because
__label__news because with one stroke our narrative itself will have become a lie this is doubly destructive not only do we fail
__label__news fail myth what are we the d list to the greatest generation but myth is no longer there for us world
__label__news world war ii cannot save us because according to the strictures of our own myth we are no longer worthy of
__label__news of being saved the bell toll for modernity is victorious resistance through new war our enforcers have other ways of describing
__label__news describing it irregular war asymmetrical war unconventional war guerilla war fourth generation war anti terrorism counter insurgency but what do these
__label__news these filtered images tell us about ourselves this is underhanded war dirty war war with those beneath us this is an
__label__news an interesting problem we want to fight a clean war with those like us on the other hand while we pursue
__label__news pursue the war we like the other pursues the war that promises survival and transcendence clausewitz himself ratified new war rsquo
__label__news rsquo s power he said that strategy at its most existential ldquo is the use of the engagement for the purposes
__label__news purposes of the war rdquo the unrecognized armed community seeks to use ldquo the engagement rdquo for its desperate purposes survival
__label__news survival and then realization to be independent this makes engagement with an unrecognized armed community fundamentally different from battle with another
__label__news another nation state which is all about negotiating relative advantage within the context of an already well established relationship but as
__label__news as we avoid relationships with unrecognized armed communities we deny their right to exist this puts us in a difficult position
__label__news position because as we deny them we unite them they fight with every fiber and for us to win we must
__label__news must be roman in our ruthlessness but we are unwilling to kill on that scale before we even enter into combat
__label__news combat we are weaker and they are stronger our war is about attacking the objects that define enemy forces with things
__label__news things that go boom their war is about their people achieving authority and turning it into legitimacy making the war about
__label__news about their goals weakens us war is where the people are and our ldquo engagement space rdquo is where the people
__label__news people are not the battlefield where armies and their weapons fight their engagement space is the heart of their inmost community
__label__news community the whole people are the fight so we are forced to fight them all not all are armed but all
__label__news all are participants our weapons are sacred things anointed by holy technology in contrast they are their weapons in a city
__label__news city our weapons cannot be used to full effect because they cannot be used indiscriminately against people their human metaphor focuses
__label__news focuses on the fighter using all at hand for the fight hence the consistently adaptable effectiveness of his ied the ultimate
__label__news ultimate people weapon is the suicide bomber and the martyr bomb is smarter than any u s technology unrelenting suicide attacks
__label__news attacks claim authority within their engagement space over an enemy whose first consideration is ldquo force protection rdquo they will not
__label__news not fight on our terms they will not fight in our engagement space and our weapons are ineffective against them yet
__label__news yet we deny that the enemy dictates the terms of battle we tell ourselves that we are ldquo taking the battle
__label__news battle to the enemy rdquo but we are really giving the enemy a path to victory killing them boosts their cause
__label__news cause ldquo shock and awe rdquo creates an instant transcendental experience for resistant communities their own london blitz shared sacrifice is
__label__news is a mythic passage of becoming the way through blood war to a new and triumphant collective identity as though the
__label__news the energy we lavish on them flows into them fighting the great state is a path to legitimacy surviving is not
__label__news not only winning it is rising and being transformed the great one you fight raises you up and speaks your name
__label__news name to the world we are midwives our efforts help birth a future that works against us the united states is
__label__news is actively dismantling its own paradigm of modernity someday we may understand what has been lost but now we unconsciously celebrate
__label__news celebrate our passing forever war makes the fall perversely satisfying as it becomes more necessary than modernity we have forced a
__label__news a fateful transformation of our sacred narrative america is now tasked with bringing the dark side to submission but of course
__label__news course we have neither the means nor the will to do so the great muslim war will keep us locked in
__label__news in so the more we thrash within our story the more we will undo ourselves our narrative has blocked every exit
__label__news exit escape officially equals retreat and retreat equals utter defeat we must never quit the fight meaning we remain willing participants
__label__news participants to our final fall this is our defeat dynamic we have set up non state triumph in iraq no matter
__label__news matter when or how we leave it we have ensured the eventual collapse of our ancien regime nation states we have
__label__news have no relationship with revolutionary communities that will succeed them tragically the transformation of the american narrative is no simple awful
__label__news awful misstep it is no neocon excursion that simply needs to be recalled at which point a sound course will set
__label__news set things right we created our inescapable struggle with islam and the world rsquo s awareness is unraveling american modernity whose
__label__news whose existence always depended on its confident future this is finished years may pass before this becomes clear so cries for

__label__news by new polling research americans are more approving of terrorist attacks against civilians than any major muslim country except for nigeria
__label__news nigeria the survey conducted in december by the university of maryland s prestigious program on international public attitudes shows that only
__label__news only percent of americans think that bombing and other attacks intentionally aimed at civilians are never justified while percent believe these

__label__news studies a washington think tank the president does not describe this as a war on terrorism said john brennan head of

__label__news terminology that mr brennan said the administration is using is that the u s is at war with al qaeda we
__label__news we are at war with al qaeda he said we are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to
__label__news to carry on al qaedas murderous agenda secretary of state hillary clinton said in march that the administration was not using

__label__news used the term war on terror on jan his fourth day as president but has not used it since mr brennans
__label__news brennans speech was aimed at outlining ways in which the obama administration intends to undermine the upstream factors that create an
__label__news an environment in which terrorists are bred the presidents adviser talked about increasing aid to foreign governments for building up their
__label__news their militaries and social and democratic institutions but provided few details about how the white house will do that he was
__label__news was specific about ways in which mr obama believes words influence the way america prosecutes the fight against terrorism mr brennan
__label__news brennan said that to say the u s is fighting jihadists is wrongheaded because it is using a legitimate term jihad
__label__news jihad meaning to purify oneself or to wage a holy struggle for a moral goal which risks giving these murderers the
__label__news the religious legitimacy they desperately seek but in no way deserve worse it risks reinforcing the idea that the united states
__label__news states is somehow at war with islam itself mr brennan said as for the war on terrorism mr brennan said the
__label__news the administration is not going to say that because terrorism is but a tactic a means to an end which in
__label__news in al qaedas case is global domination by an islamic caliphate you can never fully defeat a tactic like terrorism any
__label__news any more than you can defeat the tactic of war itself mr brennan said he also said that to call the
__label__news the fight against al qaeda and other terrorist groups which he said remains a dynamic and evolving threat should not be
__label__news be called a global war while mr brennan acknowledged that al qaeda and its affiliates are active in countries throughout the
__label__news the middle east and africa he also said that portraying this as a global war risks reinforcing the very image that

__label__news park as the local news was reporting multiple people had been by struck by lightning at schlitterbahn during the storm x
__label__news x so much for the chance of rain x i repeated testing the skepticism after that experience i gave up using
__label__news using online weather forecasts actually any weather forecast for more than getting a reasonable idea of the x temperature decade x
__label__news x for the next day i ve recently begun to be a little skeptical of my own skepticism however what if
__label__news if i was the victim of a freak waterpark occurrence and was missing out on the typically reliable weather information online
__label__news online using a spreadsheet observed data and straightforward statistics i was set to find out my plan was to record the
__label__news the weather forecasts of some of the most popular internet weather sites as well as actual temperatures and then to analyze
__label__news analyze the data to determine each site s accuracy i would then be able to draw supported conclusions to apply to
__label__news to future use of internet weather forecasts if any data mining internet weather forecasts doing an internet search for various weather
__label__news weather related keywords and then cross referencing to avoid duplication i selected the top ten weather forecast sites to be included
__label__news included in my survey using their google toolbar pagerank pr additionally i selected houston texas as the location and the weather
__label__news weather channel as my x actual temperature x source the national weather service pr bbc weather pr the weather channel pr
__label__news pr the weather underground pr intellicast pr cnn weather pr msn weather pr the weather network pr unisys pr accuweather pr
__label__news pr actual as reported on weather com then on a daily basis i recorded the predicted low and high temperatures on
__label__news on each weather forecast site going back as far as was made available this varied greatly from site to site with
__label__news with cnn weather bbc weather the weather underground and the weather network providing only the current day and four days into
__label__news into the future and accuweather providing the current day and four teen days into the future i usually logged the data
__label__news data at pm cst but occasionally as late as pm cst which resulted in some high temperature predictions for the current
__label__news current day not being available as well as oddly enough the low temperature not being available in a few cases i
__label__news i also recorded average and record temperatures for all days considered table sample portion of data sheet calculations on forecast accuracy
__label__news accuracy and consistency in order to assess the accuracy and consistency of each weather forecast site i first found the absolute
__label__news absolute values of the differences between the predicted and actual temperatures for example considering the data presented in table above the
__label__news the actual high temperature in houston tx on thursday december st was f at noon on thursday december th the weather
__label__news weather channel online predicted the high on that day would be f off of the actual and yielding an x accuracy
__label__news accuracy value x of on the same day msn weather online predicted a high of f corresponding to a value of
__label__news of the higher number indicating a poorer performance the tables turned somewhat two days later when the weather channel predicted and
__label__news and msn weather predicted resulting in accuracy values of and respectively next i calculated the mean and standard deviation of these
__label__news these accuracy values for each weather forecast site and predictive period e g accuweather two days in advance the weather network
__label__news network four days in advance etc the mean value representing the average accuracy and the standard deviation representing the consistency or
__label__news or x spread x of the accuracy values the ing tables and graphs summarize the gathered weather forecast accuracy and consistency
__label__news consistency data by organizing it into columns by the number of days previous note than in both cases a lower number
__label__news number represents a better performance table average accuracy of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous lower is
__label__news is better figure average accuracy of the high temperature forecasts of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous
__label__news previous lower is better figure average accuracy of the low temperature forecasts of each weather forecast site by the number of
__label__news of days previous lower is better table consistency of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous lower is
__label__news is better figure consistency of the high temperature forecasts of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous lower
__label__news lower is better figure consistency of the low temperature forecasts of each weather forecast site by the number of days previous
__label__news previous lower is better ranking forecasts by accuracy and consistency i then ranked the accuracy and consistency of each weather forecast
__label__news forecast site as compared to the competing sites i e the other sites providing forecasts note that days through were omitted
__label__news omitted as accuweather was the only site providing a weather forecast table accuracy rank of each weather forecast site by the
__label__news the number of days previous higher is better table consistency rank of each weather forecast site by the number of days
__label__news days previous higher is better additionally i organized the accuracy and consistency rankings with respect to short mid and longterm weather
__label__news weather forecasts as dictated by the data groupings i scored each weather forecast site with points corresponding to each ranking it
__label__news it received within the specified time period for example in order to rank weather forecast sites in the short term grouping
__label__news grouping days in advance i multiplied the number of first place ranks by added the number of second place ranks multiplied
__label__news multiplied by and continued in this manner through adding the number of tenth place rankings multiplied by the higher the score
__label__news score the higher the ranking mid and long term group rankings were similarly determined with the calculations modified to fit the
__label__news the number of participating weather forecast sites table accuracy rank groupings for short days previous mid days previous and long term
__label__news term days previous weather forecasts table consistency rank groupings for short days previous mid days previous and long term days previous
__label__news previous weather forecasts correlation of variables to weather forecast accuracy and consistency i also ran correlation analysis on various factors to
__label__news to see if they explained any of the accuracy differences observed specifically i analyzed the ing variables in order to check
__label__news check for the listed corresponding correlation trends number trends over time i numbered the days for which the temperature was being
__label__news being forecast from to starting with december and ending with january day trends with the day of the week hi lo
__label__news lo trends between high and low forecasts if the forecast was for a daytime high this value was if it was
__label__news was for an overnight low it was site trends between different sites again a column for each site was used with
__label__news with a value for when the particular site was making the prediction and a value when it was another site previous
__label__news previous trends between the number of days ahead the forecast was predicting starting with predictions made on the same day i
__label__news i e the forecast for today s high or tonight s low this value ran from to table accuracy data arranged
__label__news arranged for correlation analysis i compared the resulting correlation values with some standard values to determine if there were small medium
__label__news medium large or no trends correlating with the weather forecast accuracy numbers table standard limits for interpreting correlation values table correlation
__label__news correlation values between various variables and weather forecast accuracy these results indicated a trend for more accurate weather forecasts closer to
__label__news to the temperature in question and when a high temperature is being predicted no weather forecast site was shown to be
__label__news be significantly more accurate than another though something that does not seem to jive with the previously generated tables and graphs
__label__news graphs it is important to note however that these values are generalized over all forecasting periods and for both high and
__label__news and low temperatures i ran another correlation analysis to remove these variables just the high temperature forecasts published days previous in
__label__news in this case table correlation values by weather forecast site for high temperature forecasts made days previous these numbers again showed
__label__news showed no significant correlation between the weather forecast site and the accuracy of the weather forecast looking back at figure and
__label__news and table however this wasn t too surprising the forecast accuracies in this selection were reasonably tightly grouped with the exception
__label__news exception of bbc and bbc was on the verge of having a small correlation i made another selection and ran a
__label__news a third correlation analysis this time on the more loosely grouped accuracy values for low temperature forecasts published days previous these
__label__news these numbers showed small correlations for msn and unisys which are reflected by the relatively large separation from the pack in
__label__news in figure and table table correlation values by weather forecast site for low temperature forecasts days previous conclusion while the tabled
__label__news tabled rankings brought out the competitor in me it was obvious from the correlation analysis that only the numbers clearly x
__label__news x separate from the pack x in figures are better or worse enough as to be statistically significant thus there were
__label__news were a few shiners and a few duds but the variation among the rest can be explained away by chance the
__label__news the trends i observed included in seeking high temperature forecasts it looked best to use intellicast or the weather channel in
__label__news in the long term but there wasn t a clear leader in the short to mid term bbc seemed unreliable in
__label__news in all cases as well as msn in the long term the weather network cnn and unisys all had blemishes and
__label__news and days in advance respectively but were generally in with the pack in seeking low temperature forecasts intellicast and the weather
__label__news weather channel were again the choice in the long term joined by unisys in the short term bbc was still a
__label__news a dud in anything but the very short term and msn performed horribly in nearly all cases as well as accuweather
__label__news accuweather in the long term accuweather was the clear leader in anything greater than days in advance being the only site
__label__news site providing a weather forecast in addition to the above observations recommendations it was clear from the correlation analysis that the
__label__news the further removed a weather forecast is the less accurate it will likely be much more unexpectedly however it was also
__label__news also clear that predictions of the overnight low temperature are less accurate than those of the daytime high overall the accuracy
__label__news accuracy and consistency values prescribed caution even when considering the most accurate and consistent weather forecasts for example if i wanted
__label__news wanted to know the high temperature for tomorrow the numbers showed cnn weather to be the most accurate internet weather resource
__label__news resource its weather forecast however comes with an average accuracy value of over and a consistency value of over thus the
__label__news the conscientious browser would need to mentally append x with an accuracy of x to the temperature prediction and realize this
__label__news this results in a two degree span at best and a ten degree span at worst this means a pessimist would
__label__news would be justified in reading a prediction of x x for tomorrow s high as nothing more than x x and
__label__news and this using the best online resource available granted the optimist would also be justified in reading the same prediction as
__label__news as x x but it s always best to plan for the worst case especially when going to schlitterbahn many of
__label__news of the other less accurate weather forecasts then seem to be practically worthless for all but the most optimistic take for
__label__news for example the best option for determining the overnight low temperature a week from today the weather channel the appropriate accuracy
__label__news accuracy baggage on this internet weather forecast site would be pessimistically reducing a forecast of x x to x x perhaps
__label__news perhaps this explains why only four sites ventured to provide weather forecasts more than a week in advance and four others
__label__news others didn t even push beyond four days so what of my skepticism i d say it s going strong while
__label__news while the difference between online weather forecast sites was less than i expected the accuracy and consistency results support a strong

__label__physics modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space time and matter from that presented by classical physics quantum
__label__physics quantum theory is concerned with the discrete rather than continuous nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and
__label__physics and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena the theory of relativity is concerned
__label__physics concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to
__label__physics to an observer the special theory of relativity is concerned with relative uniform motion in a straight line and the general
__label__physics general theory of relativity with accelerated motion and its connection with gravitation both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find
__label__physics find applications in all areas of modern physics while physics aims to discover universal laws its theories lie in explicit domains
__label__physics domains of applicability loosely speaking the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the
__label__physics the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light outside of this domain observations do not
__label__physics not match their predictions albert einstein contributed the framework of special relativity which replaced notions of absolute time and space with
__label__physics with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light max planck erwin
__label__physics erwin schr dinger and others introduced quantum mechanics a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of
__label__physics of atomic and subatomic scales later quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity general relativity allowed for a dynamical
__label__physics dynamical curved spacetime with which highly massive systems and the large scale structure of the universe can be well described general
__label__physics general relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed
__label__physics developed mathematics is the language used for compact description of the order in nature especially the laws of physics this was
__label__physics was noted and advocated by pythagoras plato galileo and newton physics theories use mathematics to obtain order and provide precise formulas
__label__physics formulas precise or d solutions quantitative results and predictions experiment results in physics are numerical measurements technologies based on mathematics like
__label__physics like computation have made computational physics an active area of research the distinction between mathematics and physics is clear cut but
__label__physics but not always obvious especially in mathematical physics ontology is a prerequisite for physics but not for mathematics it means physics
__label__physics physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns even beyond the real
__label__physics real world thus physics statements are synthetic while math statements are analytic mathematics contains hypotheses while physics contains theories mathematics statements
__label__physics statements have to be only logically true while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data the distinction is
__label__physics is clear cut but not always obvious for example mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics its methods are
__label__physics are mathematical but its subject is physical the problems in this field start with a math model of a physical situation
__label__physics situation and a math description of a physical law every math statement used for solution has a hard to find physical
__label__physics physical meaning the final mathematical solution has an easier to find meaning because it is what the solver is looking for
__label__physics for physics is a branch of fundamental science not practical science physics is also called the fundamental science because the subject
__label__physics subject of study of all branches of natural science like chemistry astronomy geology and biology are constrained by laws of physics
__label__physics physics for example chemistry studies properties structures and reactions of matter chemistry s focus on the atomic scale distinguishes it from
__label__physics from physics structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other properties include physical characteristics of given substances and
__label__physics and reactions are bound by laws of physics like conservation of energy mass and charge physics is applied in industries like
__label__physics like engineering and medicine applied physics is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular use an
__label__physics an applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline like geology or electrical engineering it usually differs
__label__physics differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular but rather is using physics or
__label__physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem the approach is similar to that
__label__physics that of applied mathematics applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research for instance people
__label__physics people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics physics is used heavily
__label__physics heavily in engineering for example statics a subfield of mechanics is used in the building of bridges and other structures the
__label__physics the understanding and use of acoustics results in better concert halls similarly the use of optics creates better optical devices an
__label__physics an understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators video games and movies and is often critical in forensic investigations
__label__physics investigations with the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time physics can be
__label__physics be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty for example in the study of the origin of
__label__physics of the earth one can reasonably model earth s mass temperature and rate of rotation over time it also allows for
__label__physics for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology but there is also considerable interdisciplinarity in
__label__physics in the physicist s methods and so many other important fields are influenced by physics e g the fields of econophysics
__label__physics econophysics and sociophysics research scientific method physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory using a
__label__physics a methodical approach to compare the implications of the theory in question with the associated conclusions drawn from experiments and observations
__label__physics observations conducted to test it experiments and observations are collected and compared with the predictions and hypotheses made by a theory
__label__physics theory thus aiding in the determination or the validity invalidity of the theory a scientific law is a concise verbal or
__label__physics or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of a theory like newton s law of universal gravitation
__label__physics gravitation theory and experiment theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results
__label__physics results while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena although theory and experiment are developed
__label__physics developed separately they are strongly dependent upon each other progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that
__label__physics that existing theories cannot explain or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions which inspire new experiments physicists who work at
__label__physics at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists phenomenologists look at the complex phenomena observed in experiment and work
__label__physics work to relate them to fundamental theory theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy electromagnetism was unified this way beyond
__label__physics beyond the known universe the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues such as parallel universes a multiverse and
__label__physics and higher dimensions theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories they then explore the consequences
__label__physics consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions experimental physics informs and is informed by engineering and technology experimental
__label__physics experimental physicists involved in basic research design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers whereas those involved
__label__physics involved in applied research often work in industry developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and transistors feynman has noted
__label__physics noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well explored by theorists physics covers a wide range of phenomena from
__label__physics from elementary particles such as quarks neutrinos and electrons to the largest superclusters of galaxies included in these phenomena are the
__label__physics the most basic objects composing all other things therefore physics is sometimes called the fundamental science physics aims to describe the
__label__physics the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena thus physics aims to both connect the things observable
__label__physics observable to humans to root causes and then connect these causes together for example the ancient chinese observed that certain rocks
__label__physics rocks lodestone were attracted to one another by some invisible force this effect was later called magnetism and was first rigorously
__label__physics rigorously studied in the th century a little earlier than the chinese the ancient greeks knew of other objects such as
__label__physics as amber that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two this was also first studied
__label__physics studied rigorously in the th century and came to be called electricity thus physics had come to understand two observations of
__label__physics of nature in terms of some root cause electricity and magnetism however further work in the th century revealed that these
__label__physics these two forces were just two different aspects of one force electromagnetism this process of unifying forces continues today and electromagnetism
__label__physics electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction physics hopes to find
__label__physics find an ultimate reason theory of everything for why nature is as it is see section current research below for more
__label__physics more information research fields contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into condensed matter physics atomic molecular and optical physics

__label__physics observation of pattern formation in biological systems in horace lamb said the researchers developed a software engine called entropica and gave
__label__physics gave it models of a number of situations in which it could demonstrate behaviors that greatly resemble intelligence they patterned many
__label__physics many of these exercises after classic animal intelligence tests in one test the researchers presented entropica with a situation where it
__label__physics it could use one item as a tool to remove another item from a bin and in another it could move
__label__physics move a cart to balance a rod standing straight up in the air governed by simple principles of thermodynamics the software
__label__physics software responded by displaying behavior similar to what people or animals might do all without being given a specific goal for
__label__physics for any scenario it actually self determines what its own objective is said wissner gross this artificial intelligence does not require
__label__physics require the explicit specification of a goal unlike essentially any other artificial intelligence entropica s intelligent behavior emerges from the physical
__label__physics physical process of trying to capture as many future histories as possible said wissner gross future histories represent the complete set
__label__physics set of possible future outcomes available to a system at any given moment wissner gross calls the concept at the center
__label__physics center of the research causal entropic forces these forces are the motivation for intelligent behavior they encourage a system to preserve
__label__physics preserve as many future histories as possible for example in the cart and rod exercise entropica controls the cart to keep
__label__physics keep the rod upright allowing the rod to fall would drastically reduce the number of remaining future histories or in other
__label__physics other words lower the entropy of the cart and rod system keeping the rod upright maximizes the entropy it maintains all
__label__physics all future histories that can begin from that state including those that require the cart to let the rod fall the
__label__physics the universe exists in the present state that it has right now it can go off in lots of different directions
__label__physics directions my proposal is that intelligence is a process that attempts to capture future histories said wissner gross the research may
__label__physics may have applications beyond what is typically considered artificial intelligence including language structure and social cooperation dedeo said it would be
__label__physics be interesting to use this new framework to examine wikipedia and research whether it as a system exhibited the same behaviors
__label__physics behaviors described in the paper to me the research seems like a really authentic and honest attempt to wrestle with really

__label__physics clune a computer scientist at the university of wyoming clune who creates simulations of evolution and uses natural selection to evolve
__label__physics evolve artificial intelligence and robots expressed some reservations about the new research which he suggested could be due to a difference
__label__physics difference in jargon used in different fields wissner gross indicated that he expected to work closely with people in many fields
__label__physics fields in the future in order to help them understand how their fields informed the new research and how the insights
__label__physics insights might be useful in those fields the new research was inspired by cutting edge developments in many other disciplines some
__label__physics some cosmologists have suggested that certain fundamental constants in nature have the values they do because otherwise humans would not be
__label__physics be able to observe the universe advanced computer software can now compete with the best human players in chess and the
__label__physics the strategy based game called go the researchers even drew from what is known as the cognitive niche theory which explains
__label__physics explains how intelligence can become an ecological niche and thereby influence natural selection the proposal requires that a system be able
__label__physics able to process information and predict future histories very quickly in order for it to exhibit intelligent behavior wissner gross suggested
__label__physics suggested that the new findings fit well within an argument linking the origin of intelligence to natural selection and darwinian evolution
__label__physics evolution that nothing besides the laws of nature are needed to explain intelligence although wissner gross suggested that he is confident
__label__physics confident in the results he allowed that there is room for improvement such as incorporating principles of quantum physics into the
__label__physics the framework additionally a company he founded is exploring commercial applications of the research in areas such as robotics economics and
__label__physics and defense we basically view this as a grand unified theory of intelligence said wissner gross and i know that sounds

__label__religion recently put a pickaxe through his fax machine i explain i felt much better for it then with my next laptop
__label__religion laptop a toshiba whose screen was forever whiting out i tried to do the right thing i posted it with a
__label__religion a civil letter to mr walker at toshiba s pr company he never returned the machine or replied to my subsequent
__label__religion subsequent correspondence this has left me subject to feelings of real loathing towards mr walker which can surface at any time
__label__religion time of the night or day are you absolutely sure that mindless vandalism can never be good i think this is
__label__religion is an example where cognitive therapy could be very good for you ricard replies your problem is that you imagine mr
__label__religion mr walker had something against you personally the truth is that he had omega nothing against you at all he was
__label__religion was probably overworked if something is not going to happen you have to leave it at peace let it go i
__label__religion i know you had another laptop stolen not so long ago when you were travelling in india i didn t feel
__label__religion feel aggrieved at all ricard says adding that his only regret was that he hadn t been able to send the
__label__religion the thief the power lead but where does such passivity lead i ask ricard in less trivial circumstances let s say
__label__religion say for the sake of argument i continue that you live in a country governed by a man who has betrayed
__label__religion betrayed every principle he ever professed to believe in who habitually lies who has sent innocent citizens to die in illegal
__label__religion illegal combat he wouldn t choose to engage in himself and who accepts the hospitality of at least one world leader
__label__religion leader who is shamelessly corrupt what s the correct response to that behaviour to expose it says ricard it s important
__label__religion important to have a desire for honesty and truth but in a practical way not through hatred to take a well
__label__religion well worn example if you d found yourself armed and alone in a room with hitler at berchtesgaden in i d
__label__religion d have shot him certainly if there was no other way because it would have alleviated greater suffering somebody once asked
__label__religion asked the dalai lama what he d do if someone came in wanting to murder everyone in the room he replied
__label__religion replied i d begin by shooting at his legs if that didn t work i d move up to his head
__label__religion head he has a sense of irony then he does does he watch the marx brothers too he doesn t have
__label__religion have to his life is so full of humour although i think he used to watch mash my own limited knowledge
__label__religion knowledge of buddhism i tell ricard relates to the life of chogyam trungpa who was one of allen ginsberg s mentors
__label__religion mentors trungpa who died of cirrhosis in aged was responsible for helping to popularise the religion in britain a notorious alcoholic
__label__religion alcoholic and philanderer whose spiritual reputation suffered a public setback when drunk at the wheel of his sports car he crashed
__label__religion crashed into a joke shop on the outskirts of dumfries just as christianity is symbolised by the crucifixion for me until
__label__religion until now just the mention of buddhism has evoked the image of a robed figure lying semi conscious among pieces of
__label__religion of dashboard whoopee cushions and chattering teeth trungpa was extremely unconventional as you suggest he never tried to hide his behaviour
__label__religion behaviour i never met him i would not take him as my teacher the fundamentally unconfrontational philosophy of buddhism ricard says
__label__religion says will triumph in the end if you have a society of selfish people combined one to one with altruistic people
__label__religion people theoretically the altruists should be wiped out but altruists can co operate which gives them a strong advantage that is
__label__religion is the cause of hope hope s the right word because i don t see the world getting any better it
__label__religion it may look that way on the news ricard replies but every serious study indicates a decrease in the number of
__label__religion of deaths in armed conflict at the time of napoleon the spanish took french soldiers and nailed them between planks it
__label__religion it was the most terrible death fair enough but they were french they were ricard extinguishes the hint of a smile
__label__religion smile the point is that i do believe there is an increased tendency towards compassion in baghdad every conflict has its
__label__religion its source in hatred once the forest is on fire you re not dealing with how to extinguish the spark of
__label__religion of course you can t go and teach meditation in the midst of genocide say but in the future perhaps we
__label__religion we can shift people s thinking to discourage such developments people don t blow themselves up for no reason changes of
__label__religion of mind build slowly out of discontent greed and neglect these things have to be addressed before hatred is fully blown
__label__religion blown like the dalai lama himself ricard says he is an ardent er of the bbc world service and bbc news
__label__religion news and yet watching live reportage is hardly conducive to happiness when i ask ricard it s a question which as
__label__religion as i confess to him makes me squirm slightly but i don t think it s irrelevant in this context did
__label__religion did he last weep i cried recently because of what was it i remember it was an item on the television
__label__religion television news about people who had suffered a lot i believe it had to do with abuse i cried for a
__label__religion a long time we talk for two or three hours into the early evening i m struck by how much better
__label__religion better known ricard might have become had he applied his wit to his father s trade in philosophy and journalism and
__label__religion and how much more impressive he d have been than france s best known contemporary intellectual bernard henri l eacute vy
__label__religion vy l eacute vy who has proved more susceptible than most to the charm of his own ego recently claimed to
__label__religion to have developed stigmata and last year received his seventh cream pie in the face from the belgian n ouml el
__label__religion el godin who has made it his life s work to subvert the immaculately preened thinker as it is there s
__label__religion s only one moment in our conversation when ricard risks his karma by addressing current affairs in a waspish spirit it
__label__religion it happens when i ask him if he has even been tempted to write political articles i have because you turn
__label__religion turn on the radio and you hear jeb bush saying he is suspending capital punishment for a because it took one
__label__religion one man minutes to die and then you hear socialist presidential candidate s eacute gol egrave ne royal say i admire
__label__religion admire chinese justice because it is swift well she s right there for sure says ricard who has spent much of
__label__religion of his life attempting to repair the consequences of that nation s brutal assaults on tibet chinese justice it s swift
__label__religion swift by the time i leave he has persuaded me of the benefits to be gained from forgiving my enemies and
__label__religion and i think i can forgive them with the possible exceptions of mr walker and that bouncer at the borderline and
__label__religion and yet i tell him i know that in terms of happiness my nugget remains unpolished my bird still caged and
__label__religion and as for the treasure buried under my shack i m not even sure i remember where my shack is apart
__label__religion apart from working with the meditation exercises in happiness what should i do next there s a programme called mbsr mindfulness
__label__religion mindfulness based stress reduction developed by jon kabat zinn at massachusetts university they have produced a range of excellent tapes but
__label__religion but ultimately it s how your mind relates to the world that determines whether you re miserable or not you have
__label__religion have to ask yourself is my happiness dependent on other people it s dark by the time i leave ricard s
__label__religion s borrowed apartment walking back into the streets of the city feels like re entering another reality a bit like coming

__label__religion week later the student came back to his teacher quot my meditation is wonderful i feel so aware so peaceful so

__label__religion spread across the countryside about the wise holy man who lived in a small house atop the mountain a man from
__label__religion from the village decided to make the long and difficult journey to visit him when he arrived at the house he
__label__religion he saw an old servant inside who greeting him at the door quot i would like to see the wise holy

__label__religion house the man from the village looked eagerly around the house anticipating his encounter with the holy man before he knew
__label__religion knew it he had been led to the back door and escorted outside he stopped and turned to the servant quot
__label__religion quot but i want to see the holy man quot quot you already have quot said the old man quot everyone
__label__religion everyone you may meet in life even if they appear plain and insignificant see each of them as a wise holy
__label__religion holy man if you do this then whatever problem you brought here today will be solved quot i don t know
__label__religion know the emperor who was a devout buddhist invited a great zen master to the palace in order to ask him
__label__religion him questions about buddhism quot what is the highest truth of the holy buddhist doctrine quot the emperor inquired quot vast
__label__religion vast emptiness and not a trace of holiness quot the master replied quot if there is no holiness quot the emperor
__label__religion emperor said quot then who or what are you quot quot i do not know quot the master replied is that
__label__religion that so a beautiful girl in the village was pregnant her angry parents demanded to know who was the father at
__label__religion at first resistant to confess the anxious and embarrassed girl finally pointed to hakuin the zen master whom everyone previously revered
__label__religion revered for living such a pure life when the outraged parents confronted hakuin with their daughter s accusation he simply replied
__label__religion replied quot is that so quot when the child was born the parents brought it to the hakuin who now was
__label__religion was viewed as a pariah by the whole village they demanded that he take care of the child since it was
__label__religion was his responsibility quot is that so quot hakuin said calmly as he accepted the child for many s he took
__label__religion took very good care of the child until the daughter could no longer withstand the lie she had told she confessed
__label__religion confessed that the real father was a young man in the village whom she had tried to protect the parents immediately
__label__religion immediately went to hakuin to see if he would return the baby with profuse apologies they explained what had happened quot
__label__religion quot is that so quot hakuin said as he handed them the child nature s beauty a priest was in charge
__label__religion charge of the garden within a famous zen temple he had been given the job because he loved the flowers shrubs
__label__religion shrubs and trees next to the temple there was another smaller temple where there lived a very old zen master one
__label__religion one day when the priest was expecting some special guests he took extra care in tending to the garden he pulled
__label__religion pulled the weeds trimmed the shrubs combed the moss and spent a long time meticulously raking up and carefully arranging all
__label__religion all the dry autumn leaves as he worked the old master watched him with interest from across the wall that separated
__label__religion separated the temples when he had finished the priest stood back to admire his work quot isn t it beautiful quot
__label__religion quot he called out to the old master quot yes quot replied the old man quot but there is something missing
__label__religion missing help me over this wall and i ll put it right for you quot after hesitating the priest lifted the
__label__religion the old fellow over and set him down slowly the master walked to the tree near the center of the garden
__label__religion garden grabbed it by the trunk and shook it leaves showered down all over the garden quot there quot said the
__label__religion the old man quot you can put me back now quot we ll see there is a taoist story of an
__label__religion an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years one day his horse ran away upon hearing the news
__label__religion news his neighbors came to visit quot such bad luck quot they said sympathetically quot we ll see quot the farmer
__label__religion farmer replied the next morning the horse returned bringing with it three other wild horses quot how wonderful quot the neighbors
__label__religion neighbors exclaimed quot we ll see quot replied the old man the ing day his son tried to ride one of
__label__religion of the untamed horses was thrown and broke his leg the neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune
__label__religion misfortune quot we ll see quot answered the farmer the day after military officials came to the village to draft young
__label__religion young men into the army seeing that the son s leg was broken they passed him by the neighbors congratulated the
__label__religion the farmer on how well things had turned out quot we ll see quot said the farmer the nature of things
__label__religion things two monks were washing their bowls in the river when they noticed a scorpion that was drowning one monk immediately
__label__religion immediately scooped it up and set it upon the bank in the process he was stung he went back to washing
__label__religion washing his bowl and again the scorpion fell in the monk saved the scorpion and was again stung the other monk
__label__religion monk asked him quot friend why do you continue to save the scorpion when you know it s nature is to
__label__religion to sting quot quot because quot the monk replied quot to save it is my nature quot working very hard a
__label__religion a martial arts student went to his teacher and said earnestly quot i am devoted to studying your martial system how
__label__religion how long will it take me to master it quot the teacher s reply was casual quot ten years quot impatiently
__label__religion impatiently the student answered quot but i want to master it faster than that i will work very hard i will
__label__religion will practice everyday ten or more hours a day if i have to how long will it take then quot the
__label__religion the teacher thought for a moment quot years quot the moon cannot be stolen a zen master lived the simplest kind

__label__religion thief sneaked into the hut only to find there was nothing in it to steal the zen master returned and found
__label__religion found him quot you have come a long way to visit me quot he told the prowler quot and you should
__label__religion should not return empty handed please take my clothes as a gift quot the thief was bewildered but he took the
__label__religion the clothes and ran away the master sat naked watching the moon quot poor fellow quot he mused quot i wish
__label__religion wish i could give him this beautiful moon quot transient a famous spiritual teacher came to the front door of the

__label__religion where the king himself was sitting on his throne quot what do you want quot asked the king immediately recognizing the
__label__religion the visitor quot i would like a place to sleep in this inn quot replied the teacher quot but this is
__label__religion is not an inn quot said the king quot it is my palace quot quot may i ask who owned this
__label__religion this palace before you quot quot my father he is dead quot quot and who owned it before him quot quot
__label__religion quot my grandfather he too is dead quot quot and this place where people live for a short time and then

__label__religion to the temple to see for himself what kind of man this master was when he wasn t treated with the
__label__religion the deference and submissiveness to which he was accustomed the general burst into anger quot you fool quot he shouted as
__label__religion as he reached for his sword quot don t you realize you are standing before a man who could run you
__label__religion you through without blinking an eye quot but despite the threat the master seemed unmoved quot and do you realize quot
__label__religion quot the master replied calmly quot that you are standing before a man who can be run through without blinking an

__label__religion it is likened to a vast boat that carries all the beings in the universe across the sea of suffering within

__label__religion sang the rishis of the vedas and how to worship him through love ldquo he is to be worshipped as the
__label__religion the one beloved dearer than everything in this and the next life rdquo this is the doctrine of love declared in
__label__religion in the vedas and let us see how it is fully developed and taught by krishna whom the hindus believe to
__label__religion to have been god incarnate on earth he taught that a man ought to live in this world like a lotus
__label__religion lotus leaf which grows in water but is never moistened by water so a man ought to live in the world
__label__religion world mdash his heart to god and his hands to work it is good to love god for hope of reward
__label__religion reward in this or the next world but it is better to love god for love rsquo s sake and the
__label__religion the prayer goes ldquo lord i do not want wealth nor children nor learning if it be thy will i shall
__label__religion shall go from birth to birth but grant me this that i may love thee without the hope of reward mdash
__label__religion mdash love unselfishly for love rsquo s sake rdquo one of the disciples of krishna the then emperor of india was
__label__religion was driven from his kingdom by his enemies and had to take shelter with his queen in a forest in the
__label__religion the himalayas and there one day the queen asked him how it was that he the most virtuous of men should
__label__religion should suffer so much misery yudhishthira answered ldquo behold my queen the himalayas how grand and beautiful they are i love
__label__religion love them they do not give me anything but my nature is to love the grand the beautiful therefore i love
__label__religion love them similarly i love the lord he is the source of all beauty of all sublimity he is the only
__label__religion only object to be loved my nature is to love him and therefore i love i do not pray for anything
__label__religion anything i do not ask for anything let him place me wherever he likes i must love him for love rsquo
__label__religion rsquo s sake i cannot trade in love rdquo the vedas teach that the soul is divine only held in the
__label__religion the bondage of matter perfection will be reached when this bond will burst and the word they use for it is
__label__religion is therefore mukti mdash freedom freedom from the bonds of imperfection freedom from death and misery and this bondage can only
__label__religion only fall off through the mercy of god and this mercy comes on the pure so purity is the condition of
__label__religion of his mercy how does that mercy act he reveals himself to the pure heart the pure and the stainless see
__label__religion see god yea even in this life then and then only all the crookedness of the heart is made straight then
__label__religion then all doubt ceases he is no more the freak of a terrible law of causation this is the very centre
__label__religion centre the very vital conception of hinduism the hindu does not want to live upon words and theories if there are
__label__religion are existences beyond the ordinary sensuous existence he wants to come face to face with them if there is a soul
__label__religion soul in him which is not matter if there is an all merciful universal soul he will go to him direct
__label__religion direct he must see him and that alone can destroy all doubts so the best proof a hindu sage gives about
__label__religion about the soul about god is ldquo i have seen the soul i have seen god rdquo and that is the
__label__religion the only condition of perfection the hindu religion does not consist in struggles and attempts to believe a certain doctrine or
__label__religion or dogma but in realising mdash not in believing but in being and becoming thus the whole object of their system
__label__religion system is by constant struggle to become perfect to become divine to reach god and see god and this reaching god
__label__religion god seeing god becoming perfect even as the father in heaven is perfect constitutes the religion of the hindus and what
__label__religion what becomes of a man when he attains perfection he lives a life of bliss infinite he enjoys infinite and perfect
__label__religion perfect bliss having obtained the only thing in which man ought to have pleasure namely god and enjoys the bliss with
__label__religion with god so far all the hindus are agreed this is the common religion of all the sects of india but
__label__religion but then perfection is absolute and the absolute cannot be two or three it cannot have any qualities it cannot be
__label__religion be an individual and so when a soul becomes perfect and absolute it must become one with brahman and it would
__label__religion would only realise the lord as the perfection the reality of its own nature and existence the existence absolute knowledge absolute
__label__religion absolute and bliss absolute we have often and often read this called the losing of individuality and becoming a stock or
__label__religion or a stone ldquo he jests at scars that never felt a wound rdquo i tell you it is nothing of
__label__religion of the kind if it is happiness to enjoy the consciousness of this small body it must be greater happiness to
__label__religion to enjoy the consciousness of two bodies the measure of happiness increasing with the consciousness of an increasing number of bodies
__label__religion bodies the aim the ultimate of happiness being reached when it would become a universal consciousness therefore to gain this infinite
__label__religion infinite universal individuality this miserable little prison individuality must go then alone can death cease when i am alone with life
__label__religion life then alone can misery cease when i am one with happiness itself then alone can all errors cease when i
__label__religion i am one with knowledge itself and this is the necessary scientific conclusion science has proved to me that physical individuality
__label__religion individuality is a delusion that really my body is one little continuously changing body in an unbroken ocean of matter and
__label__religion and advaita unity is the necessary conclusion with my other counterpart soul science is nothing but the finding of unity as
__label__religion as soon as science would reach perfect unity it would stop from further progress because it would reach the goal thus
__label__religion thus chemistry could not progress farther when it would discover one element out of which all other could be made physics
__label__religion physics would stop when it would be able to fulfill its services in discovering one energy of which all others are
__label__religion are but manifestations and the science of religion become perfect when it would discover him who is the one life in
__label__religion in a universe of death him who is the constant basis of an ever changing world one who is the only
__label__religion only soul of which all souls are but delusive manifestations thus is it through multiplicity and duality that the ultimate unity
__label__religion unity is reached religion can go no farther this is the goal of all science all science is bound to come
__label__religion come to this conclusion in the long run manifestation and not creation is the word of science today and the hindu
__label__religion hindu is only glad that what he has been cherishing in his bosom for ages is going to be taught in
__label__religion in more forcible language and with further light from the latest conclusions of science descend we now from the aspirations of
__label__religion of philosophy to the religion of the ignorant at the very outset i may tell you that there is no polytheism
__label__religion polytheism in india in every temple if one stands by and listens one will find the worshippers applying all the attributes

__label__religion of others and his personal characteristics according to some opinions of islamic scholars the sunnah is the tradition of abraham s
__label__religion s religion which muhammad revived and reformed after making certain additions the emulation of muhammad s example and authentic hadith reports
__label__religion reports originating from the companions of muhammad started from the ninth century earlier sources however reflect a more flexible use of
__label__religion of the term shortly after muhammad s death actions of the rightly guided caliphs were also considered to be sunnah this
__label__religion this concept continued in shi a islam in which shi ite imams are also a source of sunnah malik ibn anas
__label__religion anas author of al muwatta the earliest extant manual of islamic law used sunnah but treated the existing practice of the
__label__religion the muslims of medina as a more reliable source of that sunnah than hadith during muhammad ibn idris ash shafi i
__label__religion i s time these flexible concepts of sunnah were challenged ash shafi i challenged other groups in his times and insisted
__label__religion insisted sunnah can only be known from reliable hadith reports he also championed the traditionalist argument that sunnah is equivalent to
__label__religion to revelation of god from the tenth century onward the canonical collections of hadith especially the collections of bukhari and muslim
__label__religion muslim became virtually synonymous with sunnah exerting a profound and pervasive impact on islamic culture shatibi writes that sunnah is either

__label__religion a hadith was originally an oral tradition relevant to the actions and customs of the islamic prophet muhammad starting from the
__label__religion the first islamic civil war of the th century those receiving the hadith began to question the sources of the saying
__label__religion saying citation needed verification needed this resulted in a chain of transmission for example a told me that b told him
__label__religion him that muhammad said the hadith were eventually recorded in form with their chain of transmission recorded and were collected into
__label__religion into large collections mostly during the reign of umar ii during th century something that solidified in the th century these
__label__religion these works are still today referred to in matters of islamic law and history western academics view the hadith collections with
__label__religion with caution as historical sources bernard lewis states that the collection and scrutiny of hadiths didn t take place until several
__label__religion several generations after muhammad s death and that during that period the opportunities and motives for falsification were almost unlimited in
__label__religion in addition to the problem of oral transmission for over a hundred years there existed motives for deliberate distortion early muslim
__label__religion muslim scholars were also concerned that hadiths may have been fabricated and thus developed a whole science of criticism to distinguish
__label__religion distinguish between genuine sayings and those that were errors or frauds modern historians point out that a chain of authorities may
__label__religion may be easily forged and that rejection of some relators implies the victory of one thought over the others hadith is
__label__religion is considered an authoritative source of revelation second only to the qur an in islamic jurisprudence the qur an contains many
__label__religion many rules for the behavior expected of muslims however there are many matters of concern both religious and practical on which
__label__religion which there are no specific qur anic rules muslims believe that they can look at the example of muhammad and his
__label__religion his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid muslim scholars also find it useful to know how muhammad
