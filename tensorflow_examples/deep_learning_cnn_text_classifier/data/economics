The Austrian School (also known as the Vienna School or the Psychological School ) is a Schools of economic thought|school of economic thought that emphasizes the spontaneous organizing power of the price mechanism.
 Austrians hold that the complexity of subjective human choices makes mathematical modelling of the evolving market extremely difficult (or Undecidable and advocate a "laissez faire" approach to the economy. Austrian School economists advocate the strict enforcement of voluntary contractual agreements between economic agents, and hold that commercial transactions should be subject to the smallest possible imposition of forces they consider to be (in particular the smallest possible amount of government intervention). The Austrian School derives its name from its predominantly Austrian founders and early supporters, including Carl Menger, Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk and Ludwig von Mises. Other prominent Austrian School economists of the 20th century include Henry Hazlitt, Murray Rothbard, and Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek. The Austrian School of EconomicsEconomics is the social science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.  Political economy was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested "economics" as a shorter term for "economic science" that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in form to "mathematics", "ethics", and so forth.[2]
A focus of the subject is how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work. Consistent with this, a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents (such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers) and markets, and their interactions. Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it, including unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy.
Other broad distinctions include those between positive economics (describing "what is") and normative economics (advocating "what ought to be"); between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioral economics; and between mainstream economics (more "orthodox" and dealing with the "rationality-individualism-equilibrium nexus") and heterodox economics (more "radical" and dealing with the "institutions-history-social structure nexus").[3][4]
Economic analysis may be applied throughout society, as in business, finance, health care, and government, but also to such diverse subjects as crime,[5] education,[6] the family, law, politics, religion,[7] social institutions, war,[8] and science.[9] At the turn of the 21st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.[10] An increasing number of economists have called for increased emphasis on environmental sustainability; this area of research is known as Ecological economics.
Economic development refers to not only increase in the output and growth of an economy but includes the various changes in the institutional arrangements through which output is generated. Economic Development refers to the achievement of a new equilibrium over the previously attained equilibrium. It is a micro economic concept with direct relation to Economic Growth as Growth can be achieved with or without development but Economic Development always results in growth.
	Trade agreement - An international agreement on conditions of trade in goods and services. 
	Trade-off - Giving up some of one thing to get some of another thing. 
	Traditional economy - A mode of economic organization which borrows economic decisions made at an earlier time or by an earlier generation 
	Unemployment - The situation in which people are willing and able to work at current wage rates, but do not have jobs. 
	Wages - The payment resource earners receive for their labor. 
	Work - Employment of people in jobs to make goods or services.
