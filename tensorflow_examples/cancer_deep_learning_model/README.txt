# Example TensorFlow Deep Neural Network using Breast Cancer Data

I assume that you have TensorFlow installed. Run the example using:

~~~~~~~~
(tensorflow) ~/cognitive_computing_book_examples/tensorflow_examples/cancer_deep_learning_model$ python cancer_trainer.py
~~~~~~~~

# Universary of Wisconsin Cancer Data

{line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
- 0 Clump Thickness               1 - 10
- 1 Uniformity of Cell Size       1 - 10
- 2 Uniformity of Cell Shape      1 - 10
- 3 Marginal Adhesion             1 - 10
- 4 Single Epithelial Cell Size   1 - 10
- 5 Bare Nuclei                   1 - 10
- 6 Bland Chromatin               1 - 10
- 7 Normal Nucleoli               1 - 10
- 8 Mitoses                       1 - 10
- 9 Class (0 for benign, 1 for malignant)

I modified the original data slightly by removing the randomized patient ID and changing the target class values from (2,4) to (0,1) for no cancer, cancer.

The CSV file loader in the TensorFlow contrib learn library expects header lines. The following is the first few lines of train.csv:

{line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
497,9,no,yes
10,10,10,8,6,1,8,9,1,1
6,2,1,1,1,1,7,1,1,0
2,5,3,3,6,7,7,5,1,1
~~~~~~~~

the first column of the header line, the value 497, indicates that there are 497 data rows in the file. The second value 9 indicates that there are 9 input values on each input line. The last value on each input line is 0 or 1 indicating the target classification.

This example just has 2 target classifications, but you can have any number. Label target class values 0, 1, 2, etc.
