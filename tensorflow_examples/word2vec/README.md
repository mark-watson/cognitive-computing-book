# word2vec example included with TensorFlow examples

I assume that you have TensorFlow installed. Since I installed TensorFlow
using Anaconda, I run the example using:

````````
~/cognitive_computing_book_examples/tensorflow_examples/cancer_deep_learning_model$ source activate tensorflow
(tensorflow) ~/cognitive_computing_book_examples/tensorflow_examples/cancer_deep_learning_model$ python word2vec_basic.py
````````

$$Warning$$: don't try to run this on a small memory system
